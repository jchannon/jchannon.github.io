&lt;p&gt;In our Startup class I added the below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions
{
    AuthenticationMode = AuthenticationMode.Active,
    CookieHttpOnly = true,
    CookieSecure = Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies.CookieSecureOption.SameAsRequest,
    SlidingExpiration = true,
    AuthenticationType = "MyCookie",
    CookieName = "MyCookie"
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully thats pretty self explanatory. So I fired up my application and BOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

    CookieName = "MyCookie"
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully thats pretty self explanatory. So I fired up my application and BOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could not load type 'Microsoft.Owin.Security.DataProtection.DpapiDataProtector' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the default security for cookie auth doesn't work on Mono. &lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt; : Install &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Owin.Security.AesDataProtectorProvider"&gt;Owin.Security.AesDataProtectorProvider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we add this to be the bottom of our OWIN middleware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.UseAesDataProtectorProvider();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up our app and bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to handle logging in our user. As we are using OWIN we need to use Claims for our authenticated users. &lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt; Install &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy.MSOwinSecurity/"&gt;Nancy.MSOwinSecurity&lt;/a&gt;, this gives us Claims support inside Nancy (in v2 of Nancy the default authentication model will be using Claims, keep an eye out for release information). Below is our login code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HomeModule : NancyModule
{
    public HomeModule()
    {
        Post["/login"] = _ =&amp;gt;
        {
            //probably best we validate the user here!!!

            var claims = new List&amp;lt;Claim&amp;gt;(new[]
                {
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, "blah@blah.com"), 
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "Mr Blah")
                });

            this.Context.GetAuthenticationManager().SignIn(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, "MyCookie"));

            return Response.AsRedirect("/");
        };
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen here is as the request comes in it will fall through the cookie middleware, fall in to Nancy, we will login and as the request reverses back up the OWIN pipeline the cookie middleware will see there is someone logged in and return a cookie in the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super duper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that authentication middleware tends to do however, is still allows requests through the pipeline even if there isn't a authenticated user. The reason being there may be other middleware that may be responsible for authenticating users in another manner.  We plan to add JWT back into our API so we would end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(); 
app.UseCookieAuthentication();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our previous use of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/Owin.StatelessAuth/"&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt; would return a 401 before it dropped through to the next middleware so we needed to swap out Owin.StatelessAuth to the MS middleware above.  The problem now is we need some more middleware to protect our API after the request has dropped through the JWT and cookie middleware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Task Invoke(IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt; environment)
{
    if (!environment.ContainsKey("owin.RequestPath"))
    {
        throw new ApplicationException("Invalid OWIN request. Expected owin.RequestPath, but not present.");
    }


    if (!environment.ContainsKey(ServerUser) || environment[ServerUser] == null)
    {
        return AuthChallengeResponse(environment);
    }

    return nextFunc(environment);
}

private Task AuthChallengeResponse(IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt; environment)
{
    environment["owin.ResponseStatusCode"] = 401;

    if (this.options != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.options.WWWAuthenticateChallenge))
    {
        var wwwauthenticatechallenge = this.options.WWWAuthenticateChallenge;

        if (!environment.ContainsKey("owin.ResponseHeaders"))
        {
            environment.Add("owin.ResponseHeaders", new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, string[]&amp;gt;());
        }

        var responseHeaders = (IDictionary&amp;lt;string, string[]&amp;gt;)environment["owin.ResponseHeaders"];
        responseHeaders.Add("WWW-Authenticate", new[] { wwwauthenticatechallenge });
    }

    return Task.FromResult(0);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(); 
app.UseCookieAuthentication();
app.CheckLoggedInUser();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have it all working but what about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery"&gt;CRSF&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Angular has some built in mechanisms to cater for CSRF and in its documentation is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session cookie called XSRF-TOKEN on first HTTP GET request. On subsequent non-GET requests the server 
  can verify that the cookie matches X-XSRF-TOKEN HTTP header, and therefore be sure that only JavaScript running on your domain could have read the token. The token must be unique for each 
  user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's authentication cookie with salt for 
  added security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we need some middleware to create this &lt;code&gt;XSRF-TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; cookie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class XSRFCookieMiddleware
{
    private readonly Func&amp;lt;IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;, Task&amp;gt; nextFunc;

    public XSRFCookieMiddleware(Func&amp;lt;IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;, Task&amp;gt; nextFunc)
    {
        this.nextFunc = nextFunc;
    }

    public  Task Invoke(IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt; env)
    {
        var context = new OwinContext(env);

        context.Response.OnSendingHeaders(_ =&amp;gt;
            {
                if ((string)env["owin.RequestPath"] == "/login" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (string)env["owin.RequestMethod"] == "POST")
                {
                    var responseHeaders = (IDictionary&amp;lt;string, string[]&amp;gt;)env["owin.ResponseHeaders"];
                    if (responseHeaders.ContainsKey("Set-Cookie"))
                    {
                        var setcookies = responseHeaders["Set-Cookie"].ToList();
                        var authcookie = setcookies.FirstOrDefault(x =&amp;gt; x.StartsWith("VQCookie"));
                        if (authcookie != null)
                        {
                            var authcookieValue = authcookie.Split(new[]{ '=' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)[1].Split(new [] { ';' })[0];
                            var csrfToken = new CsrfTokenHelper().GenerateCsrfTokenFromAuthToken(authcookieValue);
                            setcookies.Add("XSRF-TOKEN=" + csrfToken + ";path=/");
                            responseHeaders["Set-Cookie"] = setcookies.ToArray();
                        }
                    }
                }
                else if ((string)env["owin.RequestPath"] == "/api/authenticate/logout" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (string)env["owin.RequestMethod"] == "GET")
                {
                    context.Response.Cookies.Append("XSRF-TOKEN", "DEAD", new CookieOptions{ Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1) });
                }
            }, null);

        return nextFunc(env);
    }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the usage of &lt;code&gt;OnSendingHeaders&lt;/code&gt;, this is required because when a response stream is first written to in an OWIN pipeline the headers are flushed and using this event from Microsoft they will be called when the response is returned.  I had previously written this middleware similar to the below beforehand but this approach could potentially have unwanted effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public async Task Invoke(IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt; env)
{
  await nextFunc(env);
  if ((string)env["owin.RequestPath"] == "/login" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (string)env["owin.RequestMethod"] == "POST")
  {
      //
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note that cost me a few days is the ordering of these events.  Suffice to say there is no specification for this but HttpListener, Nowin &amp;amp; System.Web call these events via LIFO (Last In First Out) which means that our middleware needs to be above the &lt;code&gt;app.UseCookieAuthentication()&lt;/code&gt; line so that our event gets called after the auth cookie has been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we return the &lt;code&gt;XSRF-TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; cookie on login Angular will now detect this and then send the &lt;code&gt;X-XSRF-TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; header on every request. We now need some middleware to obviously validate this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class XSRFMiddleware
{
    private readonly Func&amp;lt;IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;, Task&amp;gt; nextFunc;

    public XSRFMiddleware(Func&amp;lt;IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;, Task&amp;gt; nextFunc)
    {
        this.nextFunc = nextFunc;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(IDictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt; environment)
    {
        var owinContext = new OwinContext(environment);

        var requestHeaders = (IDictionary&amp;lt;string, string[]&amp;gt;)environment["owin.RequestHeaders"];

        if (owinContext.Request.Method == "GET")
        {
            await nextFunc(environment);
        }
        else if (requestHeaders.ContainsKey("Authorization") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !requestHeaders.ContainsKey("Cookie"))
        {
            await nextFunc(environment);
        }
        else
        {
            if (owinContext.Request.Cookies.Count() == 0)
            {
                environment["owin.ResponseStatusCode"] = 401;
                return;   
            }

            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(owinContext.Request.Cookies["MyCookie"]))
            {
                environment["owin.ResponseStatusCode"] = 401;
                return;
            }

            if (!requestHeaders.ContainsKey("X-XSRF-TOKEN"))
            {
                environment["owin.ResponseStatusCode"] = 401;
                return;
            }

            var authCookie = owinContext.Request.Cookies["MyCookie"];

            var csrfToken = requestHeaders["X-XSRF-TOKEN"].FirstOrDefault();

            var valid = new CsrfTokenHelper().DoesCsrfTokenMatchAuthToken(csrfToken, authCookie);

            if (!valid)
            {
                environment["owin.ResponseStatusCode"] = 401;
                return;
            }

            await nextFunc(environment);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.UseXSRFCookieMiddleware();  //Add XSRF-TOKEN cookie on login
app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(); 
app.UseCookieAuthentication();
app.UseXSRFMiddleware(); //Validate XSRF requests
app.UseOwinUserVerifcation();  //Check server.User key is populated
app.UseNancy();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is the CsrfTokenHelper, below is the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CsrfTokenHelper
{
    const string ConstantSalt = "MYSALT";

    public string GenerateCsrfTokenFromAuthToken(string authToken)
    {
        return GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(authToken);
    }

    public bool DoesCsrfTokenMatchAuthToken(string csrfToken, string authToken)
    {
        return csrfToken == GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(authToken);
    }

    private static string GenerateCookieFriendlyHash(string authToken)
    {
        using (var sha = SHA256.Create())
        {
            var computedHash = sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(authToken + ConstantSalt));
            var cookieFriendlyHash = UrlTokenEncode(computedHash);  //HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode
            return cookieFriendlyHash;
        }
    }

    //Borrowed from Mono System.Web ;)
    private static string UrlTokenEncode(byte[] input)
    {
        if (input == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException("input");
        if (input.Length &amp;lt; 1)
            return String.Empty;
        string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(input);
        int retlen;
        if (base64 == null || (retlen = base64.Length) == 0)
            return String.Empty;

        // MS.NET implementation seems to process the base64
        // string before returning. It replaces the chars:
        //
        //  + with -
        //  / with _
        //
        // Then removes trailing ==, which may appear in the
        // base64 string, and replaces them with a single digit
        // that's the count of removed '=' characters (0 if none
        // were removed)
        int equalsCount = 0x30;
        while (retlen &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; base64[retlen - 1] == '=')
        {
            equalsCount++;
            retlen--;
        }
        char[] chars = new char[retlen + 1];
        chars[retlen] = (char)equalsCount;
        for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; retlen; i++)
        {
            switch (base64[i])
            {
                case '+':
                    chars[i] = '-';
                    break;

                case '/':
                    chars[i] = '_';
                    break;

                default:
                    chars[i] = base64[i];
                    break;
            }
        }
        return new string(chars);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice I had to pinch &lt;code&gt;UrlTokenEncode&lt;/code&gt; from Github from System.Web! OSS FTW! I didn't want to take a dependency on System.Web just for one method!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I'd finally got this all sorted I wanted to write some tests to check all was working for example I was getting 2 cookies after logging in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already using &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Testing/"&gt;Microsoft.Owin.Testing&lt;/a&gt; and all seemed ok however I discovered I couldn't actually test for cookies as there was no handler to pass to the HttpClient that the TestServer returns.  Luckily in all situations OWIN related &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/randompunter"&gt;@randompunter&lt;/a&gt; always has another better option, this time called &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/OwinHttpMessageHandler/"&gt;OwinHttpMessageHandler&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed me to test against cookies which the previous library didn't but then I spotted an issue on Windows. My test passed on Mono and failed on Windows, its usually the other way around.  This is where the ordering of the middleware and &lt;code&gt;OnSendingHeaders&lt;/code&gt; played a big part.  Anyway after a bit of toing and froing we discovered a bug and it was fixed however, &lt;strong&gt;beware&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft.Owin.Testing also has this bug in that it uses FIFO(first in first out).  So MS hosts act in one way but their test library works the opposite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class CookieTests
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_Have_2_Headers()
    {
        var app = GetAppBuilder();
        var handler = GetHandler(app);
        var client = CreateHttpClient(handler);

        var response = await client.PostAsync("http://localhost/login", new StringContent(""));

        var authCookie = handler
           .CookieContainer
           .GetCookies(new Uri("http://localhost"))["MyCookie"];

        var xsrfCookie = handler
            .CookieContainer
            .GetCookies(new Uri("http://localhost/login"))["XSRF-TOKEN"];

        //Then
        Assert.NotNull(authCookie);
        Assert.NotNull(xsrfCookie);
    }

    private AppBuilder GetAppBuilder()
    {
        var app = new AppBuilder();
        new Startup().Configuration(app);
        return app;
    }

    private OwinHttpMessageHandler GetHandler(AppBuilder builder)
    {
        return new OwinHttpMessageHandler(builder.Build())
        {
            UseCookies = true
        };
    }

    private HttpClient CreateHttpClient(OwinHttpMessageHandler handler)
    {
        var client = new HttpClient(handler)
        {
            BaseAddress = new Uri("http://example.com")
        };

        return client;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after some lessons learnt and bugs fixed we have Cookie Authentication &amp;amp; CRSF with AngularJs, Owin &amp;amp; Mono.  After getting this all working it was pointed out to me that Kestrel, Microsoft's new cross platform web server behaves the opposite to HttpListener, Nowin &amp;amp; System.Web in its ordering of &lt;code&gt;OnSendingHeaders&lt;/code&gt; Isn't this all fun!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see I mentioned having token and cookie middleware in the same app and that is my plan but again we have another long story and heads being bashed on the desk and that can be another blog post but the short answer is it should all work in Mono 4 from looking at the code but at the moment Microsoft's &lt;code&gt;app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication();&lt;/code&gt; does not work properly on Mono at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog post is helpful and prevents the pain I experienced with this but I guess on a positive note it was a learning experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing, I can't take the credit for the token generation etc.  I had read a Stackoverflow post about how to do CSRF with Angular and came across &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15574486/angular-against-asp-net-webapi-implement-csrf-on-the-server"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, all I have done is make it work for OWIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PinpointTownes"&gt;@PinpointTownes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/randompunter"&gt;@randompunter&lt;/a&gt; for helping me out and getting this all working in an OWIN app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/iYjnPK0.png" alt="Show the code" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I work we are moving to a Linux stack with .Net using Nancy &amp;amp; Postgres on the backend.  At the moment we have developers working in Windows and others on OSX using Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio respectively.  At the moment when we want to run the whole app, we build our project, drop to the command line and run gulp for the frontend stuff.  In Visual Studio we already have a post build event to copy the static assets to the bin directory (we have a self host and a IIS host) but in Xamarin Studio we don't so if that bin directory gets nuked we have to copy assets across VMs and its one big PITA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PostBuildEvent Condition=" '$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' AND $(ConfigurationName) == Debug"&amp;gt;  

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    npm install -verbose

    gulp --minify false --bincopy true --copyto "../MyApp.Hosting.Self/bin/debug/static/"
&amp;lt;/PostBuildEvent&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;PostBuildEvent Condition=" '$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' AND $(ConfigurationName) == Release"&amp;gt;  

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    npm install -verbose

    gulp --minify true --bincopy true --copyto "../MyApp.Hosting.Self/bin/debug/static/"
&amp;lt;/PostBuildEvent&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;PostBuildEvent Condition=" '$(OS)' == 'Windows_NT'  "&amp;gt;  
  if $(ConfigurationName) == Debug  (
    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    npm install -verbose

    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    gulp --minify false --bincopy true --copyto "../MyApp.Hosting.Self/bin/debug/static/"
  ) else (
    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    npm install -verbose

    cd $(ProjectDir)..\MyApp.Clients.AngularJS\

    gulp --minify true --bincopy true --copyto "../MyApp.Hosting.Self/bin/debug/static/"
  )

&amp;lt;/PostBuildEvent&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Idiosyncrasies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can probably see some weird things going on there so I'll explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Separate Build Events for Non-Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a separate post build event for debug and release for non windows builds, I like that, seems correct to keep them separate. However, for Windows builds I have an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.  I did get separate build events firing but then when it hit the &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; line it just wouldn't work for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Export PATH for Non-Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time trying to get gulp running on OSX. I tried it via executable shell scripts and in a post build event but it just wouldn't work but yet in the terminal all was fine.  I'm not sure if &lt;code&gt;xbuild&lt;/code&gt; gets executed as a different user or with limited privielges but I was stumped until &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yantrio"&gt;@yantrio&lt;/a&gt; pointed me in the direction of exporting the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;.  As &lt;code&gt;Gulp&lt;/code&gt; sits in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; I had to expose it to the post build event&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changing directory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post build events I change directory to the folder where the gulp file is located.  I did play quickly on doing it without changing directory but there were some disadvantages so I just went with this approach.  On Windows you'll see that I change directory after each command is executed.  For some reason when executed on Windows when the commands are run the current working directory is changed so you have to change it back to folder where you want to run gulp from.  On OSX &amp;amp; Linux you can set it once and all is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  You're asking why not use the &lt;a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8e1b4368-4afb-467a-bc13-9650572db708"&gt;Visual Studio 2013&lt;/a&gt; extension that enables running gulp from VS?  That would only work for those developers using Visual Studio and we have developers using Xamarin Studio so we wanted an across the board solution for all developers.  I know VS 2015 will have Gulp runners baked into it but I'm not sure of Xamarin Studio plans.  If you use this and get it working without a &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement for Windows let me know. &lt;/p&gt;

Well 2 months later and I'm happy to announce that intellisense works and I've added a slew of other features that will hopefully make you feel at home away from Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered the plugin thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt; but at that point there was some issues getting the intellisense working consistently because at that time I was using it with an ASP.NET vNext application which didn't have a solution file (*.sln) and the plugin was expecting that.  After speaking to Jason I found out I could change the settings so it wouldn't expect a solution file and give me the intellisense I was after in a text editor.  Eureka, it worked!  I was now on a mission to make Sublime be a first class citizen when writing C#.  Some may question why on earth would I want to edit C# in something other than Visual Studio.  I don't really want to get into that debate here but all I'll say is, it's nice to have other editor options and with Microsoft's mission to provide vNext compatibility with Mono and Visual Studio not running on OSX/Linux it makes sense to have an editor with feature rich C# support (yes I know there is Xamarin Studio but "options" people, "options").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should really introduce &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt;.  Jason is the author of a library called &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server"&gt;OmniSharpServer&lt;/a&gt; which is a -  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HTTP wrapper around NRefactory allowing C# editor plugins to be written in any language.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;NRefactory is the C# analysis library used in the SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop IDEs. It allows applications to easily analyze both syntax and semantics of C# programs. It is quite similar to Microsoft's Roslyn project; except that it is not a full compiler – NRefactory only analyzes C# code, it does not generate IL code.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms OmniSharpServer is a local web server (written in &lt;a href="http://www.nancyfx.org"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;) that accepts requests to various different endpoints which returns results about the code you sent to it.  For example, in Sublime Text when you have a string variable and you type &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; after the variable a request is sent to OmniSharpServer with a specific payload and the response contains all the possible completions for that variable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editor plugin is responsible for initiating the requests and dealing with the response in order to provide the user a rich user experience for editing C# and this is hopefully what I have done with &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime"&gt;OmniSharpSublime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mac &amp;amp; Linux users you will need Mono installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Windows users you will need Python installed and in your PATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well versed users in Sublime know there is a package manager that allows you to easily install plugins.  In the package manager if you search for OmniSharp you will see the plugin avaiable for install.  Install and away you go!  Please note that I would not consider the plugin a stable release, its close but not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier you can use OmniSharpSublime with a traditional C# solution or with an ASP.Net vNext project (that does not require a solution file) however, you will need a &lt;code&gt;sublime-project&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume you already have a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Go to "File -&amp;gt; Open" and select the folder with your solution in it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Go to "Project -&amp;gt; Save Project As" and save a YOURPROJECTNAME.sublime-project in the same location as your *.sln&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open your YOURPROJECTNAME.sublime-project file that should now appear in the sidebar on the left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter the location to the *.sln file like below&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;.sublime.project&lt;/code&gt; file should look like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "follow_symlinks": true,
            "path": "."
        }
    ],
    "solution_file": "./testconsoleprj.sln"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;code&gt;YOURPROJECT.sublime-project&lt;/code&gt; is set up and saved follow the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Close Sublime (YMMV but this seems to be the best way to open the YOURPROJECTNAME.sublime-project)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open Sublime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Click "Project -&amp;gt; Open Project", and select your YOURPROJECTNAME.sublime-project file&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the &lt;code&gt;sublime.project&lt;/code&gt; open you should be ready to edit your &lt;code&gt;*.cs&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one last "nice touch" to add to Sublime before you edit your files.  Sublime allows syntax specific settings so for C# it would be great if we could invoke intellisense when we type a full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Click "Sublime Text -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Settings - More -&amp;gt; Syntax Specific - User"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste in the below code and save&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "auto_complete": true,
    "auto_complete_selector": "source - comment",
    "auto_complete_triggers": [ {"selector": "source.cs", "characters": ".&amp;lt;"} ],
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you're ready to rock!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I will highlight some of the cool features of &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime"&gt;OmniSharpSublime&lt;/a&gt; by the power of animated gifs (hope you have a decent internet connection, sorry!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intellisense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most important features that springs to mind when editing a C# file in a text editor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/IkirwAE.gif" alt="Intellisense" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/gSuTami.gif" alt="Unit Tests" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Add/Remove from Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you create an empty chsarp file or paste a file into the folder, if you open it up and simple save the file it will be added to the &lt;code&gt;*csproj&lt;/code&gt; file. You can also right click a file and choose &lt;code&gt;Remove from Project&lt;/code&gt; and this will remove the file from a &lt;code&gt;*.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OSS FTW!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that's given you a taste of what the plugin can do and I hope you think its as cool as I do.  I believe that this will give users another option when deciding what editor to use when editing C# files.  A big thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt; for OmniSharpServer which allows the plugin to provide all the code options and for him putting up with my questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested please &lt;a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/OmniSharp"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the plugin and enjoy it.  Please let me know of any issues or features you think need adding, I already have plenty in my head but I'm sure there are more additions we can add to make the plugin better and better.  Some documentation can be found &lt;a href="http://omnisharp-sublime.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also thanks to the guys who originally came up with the idea of the plugin and to the other contributors who have already submitted pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft &amp;amp; OSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post and project has been sitting on my file system for probably 4-5 weeks ready to be published but during that time I've had chance to make new friends and add new features which I've shown you above! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Question: Why did I wait 4-5 weeks to publish this post?&lt;br /&gt;
  Answer  : Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my last &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2014/08/05/nancy-aspnetvnext-osx-sublime-text/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I'd been in touch with the authors of the Kulture plugin (&lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/18"&gt;Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi&lt;/a&gt;) who just happened to work for Microsoft.  They liked my &lt;a href="http://www.nancyfx.org"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; yeoman generator and I managed to convince them to merge my generator with their ASP.Net generator.  I asked a few questions here and there and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt; came onboard, then &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mpdreamz"&gt;Martijn Laarman&lt;/a&gt; showed some interest in getting intellisense working and soon we started growing something.  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/davidfowl"&gt;David Fowler&lt;/a&gt; was brought in to answer some questions and we started having Skype chats with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/shanselman"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; and we then decided upon the path we were going to take.  OmniSharp was born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OmniSharp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our path was going to be make C# available on all the popular editors.  Soon we had &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/stephenhjames"&gt;Stephen James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mpdreamz"&gt;Martijn Laarman&lt;/a&gt; working on making OmniSharp work with &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-atom"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt; working with &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/bbbscarter"&gt;Simon Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sp3ctum"&gt;Mika Vilpas&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jasonimison"&gt;Jason Imison&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mat_mcloughlin"&gt;Mat McLoughlin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-brackets"&gt;Brackets&lt;/a&gt; and me on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime"&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved all our repositories to an &lt;a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/"&gt;OmniSharp Github organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built a &lt;a href="http://www.omnisharp.net/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/OmniSharp/"&gt;twitter account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a &lt;a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/omnisharp"&gt;Jabbr room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets just make this clear, Microsoft were working with us to publicise and demonstrate C# working on all the major editors where we predominantly used them on OSX so Mono was going to be needed and they were happy about this!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hang on, why did you have to wait 4-5 weeks to release the blog post?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason was that Microsoft were going to have a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; announcement to make on November 12th 2014 and it was going to be that the .NET CLR was going to be built as a cross platform and open source tool and that they were going to demonstrate the work we'd been doing on OmniSharp as part of this announcement so we decided after that we'd go public so to speak!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right, .NET is going OSS &amp;amp; cross platform! HUGE NEWS and we were working as part of an OSS team with Microsoft to highlight that you can use any editor you like to build .NET applications on any platform.  It appears Leopards can change their spots. Lets hope this new open Microsoft will continue for many years to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Taking OmniSharp forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason has started working with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/KRuntime"&gt;Design Time Host&lt;/a&gt; that is used for ASP.NET vNext projects which provides information about vnext assemblies and this will be integrated into OmniSharpServer and there are areas already in OmniSharpSublime that I have highlighted that need to become more vNext focused.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sayedihashimi"&gt;Sayed&lt;/a&gt; is making changes to Kulture such as intellisense in project.json for NuGet packages, maybe our two projects will merge.  NRefactory are looking to use Roslyn for the code analysis engine underneath which effects OmniSharpServer. I'm hoping that OmniSharp will become an OSS success for all of us to gain from and I hope you will want to be apart of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, C# as a first class citizen in Sublime Text, .Net as a cross platform tool and .Net going open source.  What a day! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanselman has posted his views on OmniSharp and a cross platform OSS .NET &lt;a href="http://hnsl.mn/dotnet2015"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mat McLoughlin has posted information on the Brackets plugin &lt;a href="http://mat-mcloughlin.net/2014/11/12/time-to-cast-away-visual-studio-and-use-a-text-editor/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leave them wanting more!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been spiking NuGet support for Sublime and here's a brief intro&lt;/p&gt;

Along with this MS are developing a web server that is cross platform and goes by the name of &lt;a href="https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer"&gt;Kestrel&lt;/a&gt;.  One thing they aren't doing, yet, is making Visual Studio cross platform so we need something to write our code in.  There a few editors out there but one of the most common is &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;.  This gives you syntax highlighting and build systems that can all be configured so if you are not aware of it check it out.  Obviously before we can start writing code on OSX with our editor we need Mono installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE - As of August 13th 2014 there is a Mono 3.6 release which means you no longer need to compile Mono but you will need to install Homebrew for ASP.Net vNext. &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/#vnext"&gt;Skip to nnext section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing the official binary for Mono is 3.4.0 and this does not include some features needed for ASP.Net vNext to run so we are going to have to manually compile Mono ourselves.  Now I know this sounds scary but its not as bad as it seems and I've gone through the pain of setting it up so hopefully this blog post should make it easier for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on Mono's website on how to compile but I found some issues with it.  I'm running on OSX Mavericks so I'm not sure if that resulted in issues but here's my guide to get it compiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing the official binary for Mono is 3.4.0 and this does not include some features needed for ASP.Net vNext to run so we are going to have to manually compile Mono ourselves.  Now I know this sounds scary but its not as bad as it seems and I've gone through the pain of setting it up so hopefully this blog post should make it easier for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on Mono's website on how to compile but I found some issues with it.  I'm running on OSX Mavericks so I'm not sure if that resulted in issues but here's my guide to get it compiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
Download 3.4.0 from &lt;a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and install with the PKG installer because when compiling the latest Mono source it needs a compiler on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="http://brew.sh/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and install the dependencies as shown in Mono's guide. The guide discusses compiling these dependencies but it conflicted with something already on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install autoconf
brew install automake
brew install libtool
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You could install Mono using Homebrew if you wish but I didn't realise this until afterwards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the below and put it in a &lt;code&gt;mymonoinstall.sh&lt;/code&gt; file. Make &lt;strong&gt;$PREFIX&lt;/strong&gt; to be a folder on your system, I used &lt;code&gt;/Users/jonathanchannon/mono&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
git clone https://github.com/mono/mono.git
cd mono
CC='cc -m32' ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-nls --build=i386-apple-darwin11.2.0
sudo make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execute this by typing &lt;code&gt;mymonoinstall.sh&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal under the folder where the file is. This may take some time based on your internet connection and power of your machine but once done you should be able to run &lt;code&gt;mono --version&lt;/code&gt; and hopefully see something greater than 3.4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="vnext"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Now we have Mono installed we're ready to start coding so download &lt;a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3"&gt;Sublime Text 3&lt;/a&gt; and install it.  Once installed we need to install the ASP.Net vNext tools using the following instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew tap aspnet/k
brew install kvm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; file in your home directory and enter &lt;code&gt;source kvm.sh&lt;/code&gt;. This is so the system knows what the kvm command is when its typed into the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now need to install the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ligershark/Kulture"&gt;Kulture&lt;/a&gt; Sublime plugin that will enable us to run ASP.Net vNext from Sublime.  In Sublime open the console &lt;code&gt;View -&amp;gt; Show Console&lt;/code&gt; and paste in the below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import urllib.request,os,hashlib; h = '7183a2d3e96f11eeadd761d777e62404' + 'e330c659d4bb41d3bdf022e94cab3cd0'; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); by = urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ', '%20')).read(); dh = hashlib.sha256(by).hexdigest(); print('Error validating download (got %s instead of %s), please try manual install' % (dh, h)) if dh != h else open(os.path.join( ipp, pf), 'wb' ).write(by)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: These instructions are for Sublime Text 3. At the time of writing Kulture is only supported on version 3 so if you have version 2 you're out of luck I'm afraid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install a package manager for Sublime, you can never have too many package managers eh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bring up the Command Palette in Sublime (Cmd + Shift + P)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Package Control: Install Package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Kulture when the list appears.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have the ability to run, restore and build our ASP.Net vNext apps in Sublime we're ready to create a Nancy app.  Now you could create 4 files manually and build and run them but we might as well install another package manager that will create a Nancy app for us!  I've made a &lt;a href="http://yeoman.io/"&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt; plugin which &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-nancy"&gt;creates a Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; in Nancy for ASP.Net vNext which can be opened in Sublime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go and install &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and then open up a terminal and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-nancy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to a folder in your terminal and type &lt;code&gt;yo nancy&lt;/code&gt;, it will ask you what you want to call your app, you can type something in or accept the default and it will create the files needed to create the app.  It will also do a NuGet restore for all the dependencies the app has.  In Sublime go to &lt;code&gt;File -&amp;gt; Open Folder&lt;/code&gt; and select the folder with your app in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Go to Tools -&amp;gt; Build System and select ASP.Net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type Cmd + B&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You should see the build output in the Sublime console&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bring up the Command Palette in Sublime (Cmd + Shift + P)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type 'K' and select Run K commands&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Kestrel and a terminal window will open and you should see 'Started'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 and you should see 'Hello World' from your Nancy app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it, a Nancy ASP.Net vNext building and running from Sublime Text.  Here's a video to prove it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qZDRhNw_TPI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt; : Put a syntax error in your code and build your app and see the error reported in the Sublime console.  Double click that error line and watch it open the offending file!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For bonus points you can have a play with &lt;a href="https://github.com/moonrabbit/OmniSharpSublime"&gt;this plugin&lt;/a&gt; that aims to give C# intellisense in Sublime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingASPNETVNext.aspx"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a blog post from Scott Hanselman introducing ASP.Net vNext. There are introductory and deep dive videos available for your perusal which are also well worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR is ASP.Net vNext will take heavy influence from Node.js by using Owin to wire up all the app dependencies and middleware.  It will also remove *.csproj files and use a project.json file similar to Node's package.json and use NuGet to reference the application's dependencies.  It also takes inspiration from Node and Nancy's approach requiring you to opt-in to dependencies rather that traditionally having everything but the kitchen sink.  It also takes influence from Nancy via built in dependency injection and Mono support.  Microsoft announced they will run all their vNext tests against Mono builds ensuring all their code is compatible for cross platform deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a tweet direct from the horses mouth albeit with a typo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/XMmMDce.png" alt="vNext influenced by Node/Nancy" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe the guys at Microsoft are looking at developing an unmanaged code HTTP server to run on Mono to produce ridiculous performance which is great news!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Azure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you'll see from the videos vNext runs via the command prompt which is fine but obviously Microsoft would want to bake all the NuGet and other tooling features into Visual Studio.  A few weeks after the initial vNext details were made public Microsoft announced a pre-release of Visual Studio which had support for ASP.Net vNext.  They also &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/06/04/visual-studio-14-ctp-now-available-in-the-virtual-machine-azure-gallery.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Azure had a virtual machine in its gallery that had this version of Visual Studio installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this meant was that you could setup a VM in Azure, then use Remote Desktop to connect to the virtual machine and run Visual Studio and have a play with all the new shiny things (they also provided the ISO so you could download it and run it locally if you preferred, pretty cool huh!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you follow the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/06/04/visual-studio-14-ctp-now-available-in-the-virtual-machine-azure-gallery.aspx"&gt;above steps&lt;/a&gt; in the blog post announcing the Visual Studio release you'll see in your Azure dashboard that you can connect to the virtual machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/R6QFSjY.png" alt="Coonect to VM" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking "connect" will download the information about your virtual machine and Remote Desktop can then use it to connect to it.  As a Mac user I was able to use the OSX Microsoft Remote Desktop app and connect to my Windows virtual machine in the cloud.  This was amazing.  Once connected, on your desktop you'll see a shortcut to Visual Studio.  When you click File - New Project you'll see the vNext project types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/9hINknn.png" alt="New vNext project" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are similar options to what we've had in the past.  Creating a vNext Web Application will setup an application that has MVC and Entity Framework all wired up for you.  This is a blog post about Nancy and vNext so we'll choose &lt;code&gt;ASP.NET vNext Empty Web Application&lt;/code&gt;.  The goood news is that choosing this option will actually give is an "empty" application whereas in the past this option still contained 17 references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/Npw77Ar.png" alt="Empty application" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft have also &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/getting-started-with-aspnet-vnext-and-visual-studio"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; a "Getting Started with ASP.NET vNext and Visual Studio 14" guide if you want some more reading material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nancy and vNext&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Nancy supported Owin from the very beginning unlike MVC there was a Nancy.Owin package that you could opt-in to your application and use Nancy in an Owin based application.  This also gave you the option to use Nancy in a non-Owin application.  Today you still have that option but as of June 10th 2014 the Nancy team decided to merge a pull request moving Owin as a separate package into the core code base.  This pull request also added extensions to be able to run Nancy in a ASP.Net vNext project.  You can still run Nancy in a non-Owin application but the decision was made to embrace Owin as a first class citizen.  These changes are currently in the master branch and not yet part of an official release but to save building the source and referencing the project we can use Nancy's &lt;a href="https://www.myget.org/F/nancyfx/"&gt;nightly builds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code&gt;ASP.NET vNext Empty Web Application&lt;/code&gt; we can open up the Package Manager Console and run the following commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Install-Package DiscoverPackageSources
Discover-PackageSources -Url "https://www.myget.org/F/nancyfx/"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open up &lt;code&gt;project.json&lt;/code&gt; and under the dependency node add the below and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Microsoft.AspNet.Owin": "0.1-alpha-*",
"Nancy": "0.23-Pre1387"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice in the Solution Explorer under References that these two references have magically appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;Startup.cs&lt;/code&gt; and make it look like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace WebApplication3
{
    using Microsoft.AspNet.Builder;
    using Nancy.Owin;

    public class Startup
    {
        public void Configure(IBuilder app)
        {
            app.UseOwin(x =&amp;gt; x.UseNancy());
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a class called HomeModule and make it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;namespace WebApplication3
{
    using Nancy;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HomeModule : NancyModule
{
    public HomeModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = _ =&amp;gt; "Hello World from Nancy in ASP.Net vNext";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit F5 and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*boom&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/dkf2HF0.png" alt="Nancy running on vNext" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.Net vNext has some great changes in terms of solution architecture and developer productivity (see editing a file, pressing save, hitting F5 and the changes appearing not needing a re-compile).  Microsoft's embracing of Mono I hope will lead to a true cross platform development stack we can all work on.  ASP.Net vNext has been influenced by other major players in the OSS world and Microsoft has realised there are some great features that the community have provided for a long time now so Node, Go and Nancy should be flattered.  Its also great to see vNext on Github where poeple can see clearly the commits, issues and pull requests open for ASP.Net.  My personal belief and not an official Nancy statement is that Nancy still offers many great features that MVC and WebAPI (or I should call that MVC6 now that they've merged) doesn't but I think what Microsoft has produced in terms of vNext is awesome work and the features of MVC and new middleware can only add to the options available for .Net developers to choose from and having this choice is what its all about.  Good work Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;One more thing!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current release of Nancy is 0.23 and Nancy has been stable for a long time and is used in production for many users yet there are numerous requests for when Nancy will release a v1.0.  The response is usually "why will renaming 0.23 to v1.0 make any difference to the functionality within Nancy" mainly because its felt this is some psychological issue people have regarding version numbers.  I could do File - New Project and make it v1.0 and it could be completely unstable but does that give the perception that its more feature rich than something that is 0.23?  I think its an interesting topic how people perceive version  numbers but that discussion is for another day.  As of June 10th 2014 the Nancy team agreed that the next version of Nancy will not be 0.24 but in fact be v1.0.0.  There are more finer details about the v1.0 release which &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thecodejunkie"&gt;TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt; will be blogging about soon but hopefully this release will attract more people to use Nancy that may have been put off by the version number in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of .Net development is looking good. Go out and code up a storm =)&lt;/p&gt;

By default on OSX this behaviour is not present and it frustrated me enough to go and find out how to enable that behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up your terminal and type in this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will download a git completion file into your home folder to a hidden file called git-completion.bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the file ~/.bash_profile does not already exist create it with the following command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch ~/.bash_profile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open it and paste this in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then . ~/.git-completion.bash; fi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you type a git command and press tab, BOOM!, you have auto complete for Git!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you type a git command and press tab, BOOM!, you have auto complete for Git!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also by default if you're in a directory that has a git repository inside it will not show you the branch you're on.  Again in Console2 in Windows it does however we can get the same functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the .bash_profile and paste the below in, save and reopen your terminal and bingo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Git branch in prompt.
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2&amp;gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \W\[\033[32m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later whilst I was using Console2 I wanted to have the date/time in my prompt so I know when I last used the git command.  If you look at the code above you'll see the PS1 variable which controls what you prompt will look like.  The variables in there eg\ &lt;code&gt;\W&lt;/code&gt; all mean different things. Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-linux-unix-bash-shell-setup-prompt.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to explain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in Console to I executed &lt;code&gt;echo $PS1&lt;/code&gt; which showed me my current settings. I used the above link to help me and I added the datetime with a color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before :  &lt;code&gt;\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:${PWD//[^[:ascii:]]/?}\007\]\n\[\033[32m\]\u@\h\[\033[33m\]\w$(__git_ps1)\[\033[0m\]\n\ \[\033[0m\]$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After :  &lt;code&gt;\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:${PWD//[^[:ascii:]]/?}\007\]\n\[\033[32m\]\u@\h\[\033[33m\]\w$(__git_ps1)\[\033[0m\]\n\[\033[31m\]\t \[\033[0m\]$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if this is all a bit much for you I was told about &lt;a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;, a OSX terminal replacement and &lt;a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh"&gt;Oh My Zsh&lt;/a&gt; a way to configure your terminal that provides lots of plugins and themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this is helpful for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a great package and does a great job but what if one day you want to use &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr"&gt;SignalR&lt;/a&gt; v2 that uses &lt;a href="http://owin.org/"&gt;OWIN&lt;/a&gt; and you want to validate not just requests to your Nancy app but also the SignalR requests?  You're going to need to validate requests as they come in before they get to SignalR or Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are not quite up to date or unsure what OWIN is let me try and give you the tl:dr, no doubt others may say its something slightly different.  Imagine you are asked to create a ASP.Net MVC 3 app (ignore the fact that that person needs a slap) so you fire up Visual Studio and create the app.  So what has it done? Its created an app that runs on IIS and all requests come straight into your app.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are not quite up to date or unsure what OWIN is let me try and give you the tl:dr, no doubt others may say its something slightly different.  Imagine you are asked to create a ASP.Net MVC 3 app (ignore the fact that that person needs a slap) so you fire up Visual Studio and create the app.  So what has it done? Its created an app that runs on IIS and all requests come straight into your app.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter OWIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What OWIN introduces is an HTTP abstraction from the host to framework and therefore you have access to the whole request at any point. As an example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/bbaia/connect-owin-samples/tree/master/Samples.Nancy"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a node.js web server (replacing IIS) and then calling out to Nancy.  Pretty cool huh!  As HTTP is abstracted you can have two applications, one in Nancy and one in WebAPI in the same project and via OWIN you can tell it which requests go to Nancy and which go to WebAPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the HTTP abstraction we can now inspect the requests and then determine whether we should return a 401 or let the request continue. So how does that look?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
         app
           .RequiresStatelessAuth(new MySecureTokenValidator())
           .MapSignalR() //This could be WebAPI etc
           .UseNancy();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an OWIN app we need a Startup class to configure our application and we wire up the requests and how they may be handled in order of processing.  So as I stated earlier we want to use SignalR and Nancy and validate the requests before they hit our application, using &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Owin.StatelessAuth/"&gt;Owin.StatelessAuth&lt;/a&gt; we can do that.  It takes an implementation of &lt;code&gt;ITokenValidator&lt;/code&gt; where a method gets called to determine if the request is valid by passing in a token from the &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header.  How you implement the interface and determine what is a valid request is up to you.  Luckily I have a demo available in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/Owin.StatelessAuth"&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; which I'll now explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Demo Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 days after publishing &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/Owin.StatelessAuth"&gt;Owin.StatelessAuth&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Hadlow published a great &lt;a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/json-web-tokens-owin-and-angularjs.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on using JWT (JavaScript Web Tokens) &amp;amp; OWIN &amp;amp; Angular so I thought I would do a similar post just to throw my 2 cents in.  Its going to be hard not to say the same things as Mike so I may skip some stuff but it just means you should read his post too!  So lets get the code to do the talking...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup.cs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        app.RequiresStatelessAuth(
              new MySecureTokenValidator(new ConfigProvider()), 
              new StatelessAuthOptions() {IgnorePaths = new List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(new []{"/login","/content"})})
            .UseNancy();

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we pass in our implementation of ITokenValidator called MySecureTokenValidator and pass in some options to Owin.StatelessAuth which says if the paths contain the items in the list then Owin.StatelessAuth will not try and authenticate those requests.  In the demo we have javascript and images in the content folder so we don't want to authenticate those requests.  We also don't want to authenticate requests to the login path.  Why not? This is the route that will give us the token for all subsequent requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public HomeModule(IConfigProvider configProvider, IJwtWrapper jwtWrapper)
{
    Get["/login"] = _ =&amp;gt; View["Login"];

    Post["/login"] = _ =&amp;gt;
    {
        var user = this.Bind&amp;lt;UserCredentials&amp;gt;();

        //Verify user/pass
        if (user.User != "fred" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; user.Password != "securepwd")
        {
            return 401;
        }

        var jwttoken = new JwtToken()
        {
            Issuer = "http://issuer.com",
            Audience = "http://mycoolwebsite.com",
            Claims =
                new List&amp;lt;Claim&amp;gt;(new[]
                {
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Administrator"),
                    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "Fred")
                }),
            Expiry = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7)
        };

        var token = jwtWrapper.Encode(jwttoken, configProvider.GetAppSetting("securekey"), JwtHashAlgorithm.HS256);
        return Negotiate.WithModel(token);
    };

    Get["/"] = _ =&amp;gt; "Hello Secure World!";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here on the GET request to login we return a view where Angular wil be used.  On the POST request to login we Bind the posted values to a class called UserCredentials, we then need to validate these credentials (I assume yours will be better than mine) and then create a new instance of JwtToken which is just another class in our application which has properties that relate to the &lt;a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html"&gt;JWT spec&lt;/a&gt; and then we encode the object to return a token for our user using the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/JWT/"&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt; library (I have created a wrapper for it in the demo as they are static methods out of the box).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angular View&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" ng-app="owinstatelessauthexample"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body ng-controller="appCtrl"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Login&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;form ng-submit="getToken()"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="text" name="user" ng-model="user" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="password" name="password" ng-model="password" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="submit" value="Login" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;Status: {{loggedinstatus}}&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;{{secureresponse}}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button ng-click="getsecureresponse()"&amp;gt;Get Secure Response&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;script src="/content/localforage.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src="/content/angular-localforage.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src="/Content/app.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a form that will POST to our login route, a label to show our logged in status, a button to hit our route that should return "Hello Secure World"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angular Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(function () {
    'use strict';

    var app = angular.module('owinstatelessauthexample', ['LocalForageModule'])
        .controller('appCtrl', ['$scope', '$localForage', '$http', function ($scope, $localForage, $http) {
            // Start fresh
            $localForage.clearAll();

            $scope.user = 'fred';
            $scope.password = 'securepwd';
            $scope.secureresponse = '';
            $scope.loggedinstatus = 'Not Logged In';

            $scope.getToken = function () {
                $http({
                    method: 'POST',
                    url: '/login',
                    data: {
                        "user": $scope.user,
                        "password": $scope.password,
                    }
                })
                    .success(function (data, status) {
                        console.log('All ok : ' + data);
                        $localForage.setItem('mysecuretoken', JSON.parse(data));
                        $scope.loggedinstatus = 'Logged In';
                    })
                    .error(function (data, status) {
                        console.log('Oops : ' + data);
                    });

            };

            $scope.getsecureresponse = function () {
                $localForage.get('mysecuretoken').then(function (data) {
                    $http({
                        method: 'GET',
                        url: '/',
                        headers: { 'Authorization': data }

                    })
                   .success(function (data, status) {
                       console.log('All secure : ' + data);
                       $scope.secureresponse = data;
                   })
                   .error(function (data, status) {
                       console.log('Oops : ' + data);
                       $scope.secureresponse = "Oops!" + data;
                   });
                });

            };
        }]);

})();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the form from our view is posted to our login route we get take the response data and store it in localStorage.  However, here we are using a library called &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/localForage"&gt;localForage&lt;/a&gt; which has a fallback option if you don't have HTML5 in your browser.  When the user clicks the button to hit our secure route it will retrieve the token from localForage and pass it in the request and hopefully we get the expected response as Owin.StatelessAuth will validate it via MySecureTokenValidator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MySecureTokenValidator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MySecureTokenValidator : ITokenValidator
{
    private readonly IConfigProvider configProvider;

    public MySecureTokenValidator(IConfigProvider configProvider)
    {
        this.configProvider = configProvider;
    }

    public ClaimsPrincipal ValidateUser(string token)
    {
        try
        {
            //Claims don't deserialize :(
            //var jwttoken = JsonWebToken.DecodeToObject&amp;lt;JwtToken&amp;gt;(token, configProvider.GetAppSetting("securekey"));

            var decodedtoken = JsonWebToken.DecodeToObject(token, configProvider.GetAppSetting("securekey")) as Dictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;;

            var jwttoken = new JwtToken()
            {
                Audience = (string)decodedtoken["Audience"],
                Issuer = (string)decodedtoken["Issuer"],
                Expiry = DateTime.Parse(decodedtoken["Expiry"].ToString()),
            };

            if (decodedtoken.ContainsKey("Claims"))
            {
                var claims = new List&amp;lt;Claim&amp;gt;();

                for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; ((ArrayList)decodedtoken["Claims"]).Count; i++)
                {
                    var type = ((Dictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;)((ArrayList)decodedtoken["Claims"])[i])["Type"].ToString();
                    var value = ((Dictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;)((ArrayList)decodedtoken["Claims"])[i])["Value"].ToString();
                    claims.Add(new Claim(type, value));
                }

                jwttoken.Claims = claims;
            }

            if (jwttoken.Expiry &amp;lt; DateTime.UtcNow)
            {
                return null;
            }

            return new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(jwttoken.Claims, "Token"));
        }
        catch (SignatureVerificationException)
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first comment in the code is that the class &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.claims.claim(v=vs.110).aspx"&gt;Claim&lt;/a&gt; won't deserialize which would have made our code a one liner but unfortunately not. Possibly if the JWT library used JSON.Net or ServiceStack.Text it may work but for now I had to do some logic to assign the properties of the JwtToken class.  It really is some ugly code so hopefully a PR or so to JWT it may be cleaned up.  So we decode the token to a dictionary and then assign the values to our class, loop over the claims, see if the expiry date is before now and if so return null which will cause Owin.StatelessAuth to return a 401.  If all is well we return a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal.aspx"&gt;ClaimsPrincipal&lt;/a&gt; instance.  Owin.StatelessAuth will add it to the Owin environment which can be read further down the request stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy Bootstrapper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Bootstrapper : DefaultNancyBootstrapper
{
    protected override void RequestStartup(TinyIoCContainer container, IPipelines pipelines, NancyContext context)
    {
        base.RequestStartup(container, pipelines, context);
        var owinEnvironment = context.GetOwinEnvironment();
        var user = owinEnvironment["server.User"] as ClaimsPrincipal;
        if (user != null)
        {
            context.CurrentUser = new DemoUserIdentity()
            {
                UserName = user.Identity.Name,
                Claims = user.Claims.Where(x =&amp;gt; x.Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role").Select(x =&amp;gt; x.Value)
            };
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy has a CurrentUser property on the NancyContext, if this is not null then we know the user is authenticated.  In the introduction of the blog post I mentioned Nancy.Authentication.Stateless (other Nancy.Authentication libraries are available) which does exactly that, it assigns the the CurrentUser to the validated user.  In our Bootstrapper we use the ClaimsPrincipal instance in the Owin environment that Owin.StatelessAuth put in there for us to assign the properties of &lt;code&gt;IUserIdentity&lt;/code&gt; in Nancy to assign the current user.  We can then use &lt;code&gt;RequiresAuthentication&lt;/code&gt; on our Nancy routes to secure routes based on extra security such as claim types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have now is a way using Owin.StatelessAuth to secure all incoming requests, the option to ignore some requests for authentication, a way for tokens to be issued, a way for them to be validated and the ability to assign Nancy's user to the user we validated using Owin.StatelessAuth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed writing Owin.StatelessAuth middleware component and the demo with it so please take a look, any constructive feedback welcomed along with pull requests :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally just to prove this works, here's some pretty pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POST to generate a token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/FlI4NAi.png" alt="Post Get Token" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET with our token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/GeCP9IJ.png" alt="Get Secure Request" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Using Express allows you to get up and running very quickly without to much head scratching so I felt a standalone script would give me more exposure to things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the previous couple of weeks at work I wrote a console app that downloaded zip file from a FTP server, extract the contents, read data in a XML file that was in the zip, do some string matching and upload the zip to another FTP server.  I figured this would be a good app to replicate in node so off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of &lt;a href="http://npmjs.org"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; research I found the modules I needed and managed to get to the point of downloading files pretty easily with the below code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var path = require('path');
var fs = require('fs');
var Promise = require('bluebird');
var Client = require('ftp');

var c = new Client();

var connectionProperties = {
    host: "myhost",
    user: "myuser",
    password: "mypwd"
};

c.on('ready', function () {
    console.log('ready');
    c.list(function (err, list) {
        if (err) throw err;
        list.forEach(function (element, index, array) {
            //Ignore directories
            if (element.type === 'd') {
                console.log('ignoring directory ' + element.name);
                return;
            }
            //Ignore non zips
            if (path.extname(element.name) !== '.zip') {
                console.log('ignoring file ' + element.name);
                return;
            }
            //Download files
            c.get(element.name, function (err, stream) {
                if (err) throw err;
                stream.once('close', function () {
                    c.end();
                });
                stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(element.name));
            });
        });
    });
});

c.connect(connectionProperties);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I originally had that code in a function and wanted to call it and then call another function to read the files that I had downloaded but what I found was callback hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter Promises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to know that all the files had downloaded and then I could read the files in a directory ready for zip extraction but I couldn't work out how.  I discovered promises and probably didn't read enough about all the ins and outs of them but I remember &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/gblock"&gt;Glenn Block&lt;/a&gt; giving a talk about &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennblock/codemash-async"&gt;async programming in node&lt;/a&gt; so I pestered him on Twitter and he kindly helped and me out and also pointed me towards his code and slides where I decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/"&gt;Bluebird&lt;/a&gt;, the promise library.  Unfortunately I just couldn't get the files downloaded. It would download one file but not the other and closed the streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of what I had (brace yourself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var processListing = function (directoryItems) {
    var itemsToDownload = [];
    directoryItems.forEach(function (element, index, array) {
        //Ignore directories
        if (element.type === 'd') {
            console.log('directory ' + element.name);
            return;
        }
        //Ignore non zips
        if (path.extname(element.name) !== '.zip') {
            console.log('ignoring ' + element.name);
            return;
        }
        //Download zip
        itemsToDownload.push({
            source: element.name,
            destination: element.name
        });
    });
    return itemsToDownload;
};

var processItem = function (object) {
    return aFtpClient.getAsync(object.source);
};

var downloadFiles = function () {
    console.log('downloading files');
    aFtpClient.
    listAsync().
    then(processListing).
    map(function (object) {
        return processItem(object).then(function (processResult) {
            return {
                input: object,
                result: processResult
            };
        });
    }).
    map(function (downloadItem) {
        downloadItem.result.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(process.cwd() + "/zips/" + downloadItem.input.destination));
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            downloadItem.result.once("close", function () {
                console.log('closed');
                resolve();
            });
        });
    }).done()
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is that a tad complicated but I could not for the life of me understand what the hell was happening and why it wasn't downloading all the files.  I reached out to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PrabirShrestha"&gt;@PrabirShrestha&lt;/a&gt; who agreed it was a tad over complicated and tried to help but recommended I take a look at Reactive Extensions, maybe I will in the future but at this point my frustration had kicked in and I wanted to give up.  I went through a mixture of emotions from frustration, which led to anger, fuming anger, denial, then apathy.  Although these emotions went by and after a couple of questions on stackoverflow that helped but didn't give the solution I explained the issue to a colleague and we both took a look.  I went through a few iterations with no luck and after a bit more reading I think we were closing in on it individually but I was beaten to it. All hail &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/iamnerdfury"&gt;@iamnerdfury&lt;/a&gt; who produced this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var connect = function() {
    c.connect(connectionProperties);
    return c.onAsync('ready');
};

var getList = function() {
    return c.listAsync();
};

var zipFiles = function(element) {
    return element.type !== 'd' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; path.extname(element.name) === '.zip';
};

var current = Promise.resolve();

var downloadFiles = function(file) {
    current = current.then(function() {
        return c.getAsync(file.name)
    }).then(function(stream) {
        stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(file.name));
        console.log(file.name + ' downloaded..');
    });
    return current;
};

connect().then(getList).filter(zipFiles).map(downloadFiles).done();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the previous issues I had was I was returning &lt;code&gt;resolve()&lt;/code&gt; after the first file downloaded which is not what you want to do when multiple calls to it are executed as a promise can only resolve once.  I needed to find some way of concatenating a promise somehow for each file that is downloaded. I looked at the &lt;code&gt;all()&lt;/code&gt; command but I couldn't get it to fit but @iamnerdfury found that you could do this via creating an instance of a promise by calling resolve and then assign to it on each file that needed to be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know the files are downloaded I can chain more functions to read the file system, extract the zip for each one, read the XML and upload to a new server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone else because it wound me up something chronic and whilst I get pissed off with JavaScript when things like this happen I will keep at it because I think node is now becoming a serious contender and us developers need to keep a finger in many pies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you think there is a way to improve the solution above I'd love to hear it)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        {
            //Do something special
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously &lt;code&gt;myService&lt;/code&gt; has a interface that can be mocked and I can tell it to throw a &lt;code&gt;EntityCommandExecutionException&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;DoSomethingThatMightTakeALongTime&lt;/code&gt; is called and the constructor for that takes a string and an Exception as an inner exception.  However, you can't create a new instance of SqlException because its a sealed class therefore doing the below is impossible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var fakeService = A.Fake&amp;lt;IMyService&amp;gt;();
A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; fakeService.DoSomethingThatMightTakeALongTime()).Throws(new EntityCommandExecutionException("What a mistaka da maka", new SqlException());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't create your own exception class and inherit off SqlException to get around it that way either.  You could use &lt;code&gt;System.Runtime.Serialization.FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject&lt;/code&gt; to give you a &lt;code&gt;SqlException&lt;/code&gt; but that won't have the &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; property assigned to -2.  You could also setup a method in your test class that tries to connect to a non existant db that times out after 1 second but again that won't give you the Number property you may want plus its a lot of ugly and unnecessary code in a unit test project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did you do it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after browsing all the stackoverflow answers and comments I came up with a solution that worked which I thought I'd share so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private SqlException GetSqlException()
{
    SqlErrorCollection collection = Construct&amp;lt;SqlErrorCollection&amp;gt;();
    SqlError error = Construct&amp;lt;SqlError&amp;gt;(-2, (byte)2, (byte)3, "server name", "error message", "proc", 100, (uint)1);

    typeof(SqlErrorCollection)
        .GetMethod("Add", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)
        .Invoke(collection, new object[] { error });    

    var e = typeof(SqlException)
        .GetMethod("CreateException", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static, null, CallingConventions.ExplicitThis, new[] { typeof(SqlErrorCollection), typeof(string) }, new ParameterModifier[] { })
        .Invoke(null, new object[] { collection, "11.0.0" }) as SqlException;

    return e;
}

private T Construct&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(params object[] p)
{
    return (T)typeof(T).GetConstructors(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)[0].Invoke(p);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then amend the previous mocking code to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var fakeService = A.Fake&amp;lt;IMyService&amp;gt;();
A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; fakeService.DoSomethingThatMightTakeALongTime()).Throws(new EntityCommandExecutionException("What a mistaka da maka", GetSqlException());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it uses reflection to create instances of all the sealed classes required and it also calls sealed methods to assign properties ie/adding the error instance to the collection instance.  You'll see that the -2 value is the first argument in the parameters used to construct the SqlError object so if you're interested in using the Number property on the exception thats where to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works and allows me to test my code but all in all its not particualry elegant and the following gif can sum up what we've learnt from sealed methods and classes and thats they're &lt;em&gt;nasty&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was discussing with a colleague about using node at work and that we needed something seperate and small just to try it out and see how the whole developement process with it worked.  As the database that this app needed to communicate with was MSSQL I looked into a library on NPM that would communicate with MSSQL and maybe act as an ORM.  There was a Microsoft lib that seemed untouched and reading the comments on the issues list on Github it didnt favour too well.  There were libraries that would communicate with MySQL &amp;amp; PostgresSQL but not MSSQL.  In my search I came across edge.js again.  It had 2 samples, one that used edge-sql and one that used ScriptCS so in laymans terms, one that used a precompiled dll and one that used a C# script that was executed at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

As the database that this app needed to communicate with was MSSQL I looked into a library on NPM that would communicate with MSSQL and maybe act as an ORM.

It had 2 samples, one that used edge-sql and one that used ScriptCS so in laymans terms, one that used a precompiled dll and one that used a C# script that was executed at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the samples the Github repo gave you could do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var edge = require('edge');

var getTop10Products = edge.func('sql', function () {/*
    select top 10 * from Products
*/});

getTop10Products(null, function (error, result) {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(result);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats it, you could call &lt;code&gt;node myscript&lt;/code&gt; and it would log out the values of the result variable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this did was in fact send the SQL string to a compiled dll which had a class and async method in it that was setup to respond to calls from node js.  This method essentially returned a C# &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that was serialized to JSON so the node.js function could interact with it.  The one issue I saw with it was the actual format of the JSON.  It was a 2 dimentional array, with the first array in the parent array containing the column names and the subsequent arrays containing values from the rows in the SQL result.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time to roll up your sleeves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I liked the fact that I could now return data from MSSQL with node its format wasnt quite right.  I forked the project on Github and then looked at the way it was executing the SQL and storing it in a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Whilst I kept the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; return type the information inside it differed.  I was now using &lt;code&gt;var dataObject = new ExpandoObject() as IDictionary&amp;lt;string, Object&amp;gt;;&lt;/code&gt; and for each field in the resulting SQL dataset I populated it like so &lt;code&gt;dataObject.Add(record.GetName(i), resultRecord[i]);&lt;/code&gt; ie/ the column name and corresponding value.  So this looped over the sql storing objects in a list and then returning it as JSON as it did before.  What this meant was that the API had now changed so I could refer to the column names as object properties on the node object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;getTop10Products(null, function (error, result) {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(result[0].ProductName);
    console.log(result[1].UnitPrice);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now just out of curisotiy I wanted to right a sample ExpressJS app to see how I could use this to have a JS file that acted as a C# repository to do all the data access.  I'll let you look into setting express up yourself but what I managed to do was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;server.js&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var express = require('express');
var edge = require('edge');
var index = require('./index.js');
var db = require('./db.js');

var app = express();

app.get('/', index.home(db));

app.listen(999);
console.log('Listening on port 999')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;db.js&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var edge = require('edge');

exports.getProducts = edge.func('sql', function() {/*
                    select top 10 * from Products 
                 */});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;index.js&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.home = function(db) {
    return function(req, res) {
        db.getProducts(null, function(error, result) {
            if (error) throw error;
            var data = {};
            data.all = result;
            data.Item1Name = result[0].ProductName;
            data.Item2ReorderLevel = result[1].ReorderLevel;
            res.send(data);
        });
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fired up a browser and pointed it at http://localhost:999 and it returned showed me my 10 products, then my first item's product name and second item's re-order level. Consider me pleased!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people will think using MSSQL for a node app seems odd but if you want to spike something up and/or only have access to a MSSQL db for whatever reason you can now do it very easily and actually quite elegantly.  You execute your SQL and you get back a JSON object that represents your data, same as any other SQL/NOSQL database.  Give it a whirl and see how you get on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically a web application will have web.config and a web.Release.config as well as other derivations you may use.  Octopus also supports web.[Environment].config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a console application you have an app.config and maybe a app.Release.config if you create one.  Deploying this via Octopus won't invoke the XML transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is to rename the app.Release.config to be the name of the final config file produced by the build along with the 'exe' extension in it and to make sure in Visual Studio you set the build to Copy Always on the MyApp.exe.Release.config file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example if your project is called MyApp and you have an app.config and app.Release.config, open Windows Explorer and rename it to MyApp.exe.Release.config.  Visual Studio won't allow you to rename these files that are dependent on another so you now have to open up MyApp.csproj and alter the references from app.Release.config to MyApp.exe.Release.config&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Content Include="App.config" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Content Include="MyApp.exe.Release.config" &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;DependentUpon&amp;gt;App.Config&amp;lt;/DependentUpon&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Content&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go into VS, Reload All when it prompts you and set the Copy to Output Directory value to Copy Always&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/E8Kbezh.jpg" alt="VS Property Window" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you deploy Octopus should run the transformation and replace connection strings etc as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTrack uses TeamCity to get the information about the commits and then scans the commit comment for a YouTrack item id and any commands that it can apply such as item status or time spent on said item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some documentation &lt;a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/YTD4/Executing+Commands+from+Comment+to+VCS+Commit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but its not the greatest in terms of clarity and I've spoken to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hhariri"&gt;Hadi Hariri&lt;/a&gt; from JetBrains about improving this so hopefully they're working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow here's some example Git commands to wire it all up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -am "I fixed a massive bug #PROJ-158 Complete"
git commit -am "I fixed a massive bug #PROJ-158 Complete add work 1h"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first command will update the status of YouTrack item #PROJ-158 to Complete.  The second item will do the same but also add Time Tracking information to the item in YouTrack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps, Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

One of them being able to run your tests from a keystroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to expand my mind I'm working on a little project that is made up of JS entirely so I've dug out &lt;a href="http://sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;. It has lots of plugins that are very handy, especially &lt;a href="https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify"&gt;Sublime-HTMLPrettify&lt;/a&gt; which will tidy your HTML, CSS &amp;amp; JS for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing tests for JS there are many libraries you can use but I've chosen &lt;a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/"&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt; for now.  The one thing I couldn't work out was to run my tests within Sublime Text until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sublime allows you to have build systems a bit like an IDE so you can tell it what to do when you invoke it via &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;B&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get Mocha to run we need to create a new build system. To do this click Tools - Build System - New Build System and paste in the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sublime allows you to have build systems a bit like an IDE so you can tell it what to do when you invoke it via &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;B&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get Mocha to run we need to create a new build system. To do this click Tools - Build System - New Build System and paste in the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "cmd": ["make"],
    "file_regex": "^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$",
    "working_dir": "${project_path:${folder:${file_path}}}",
    "selector": "source.makefile",
    "shell": true,
    "variants": [{
        "name": "Clean",
        "cmd": ["make", "clean"]
    }]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click Save and call it Mocha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you have a project go to Tools - Build System and select Mocha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Make file is a script that allows you to execute various commands and its what our build system looks for when we tell Sublime to build our project. We need a file called &lt;code&gt;makefile&lt;/code&gt; in the root of our project.  Inside that &lt;code&gt;makefile&lt;/code&gt; we can invoke Mocha to run our tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place this in your &lt;code&gt;makefile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;test:
    mocha --recursive --reporter spec moviebucketlist.tests/*.js
.PHONY: test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you invoke the build system via &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;B&lt;/kbd&gt; in Sublime it will execute Mocha and give you the results in the console of Sublime.  Mocha by default will look for a folder called &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; and execute the tests inside it. If you have a different folder name you can append the folder name and wildcard to js files like I have done above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly, it is written in .Net and &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt;, secondly its a static blog generator and finally it supports Git deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't want to use Git deployment you can use FTP, its a great tool.  To write your blog post in Markdown you need a custom header in your file so it knows some information about your post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
layout: post
category: Azure
title: Setting up a ServiceStack Service
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then parses this information along with your Markdown into its engine, uses a Markdown view engine to convert the file content into HTML, assign model properties based on the header and creates a HTML file using the model via a Razor viewengine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "layout" refers to the Razor file it uses to render the final HTML file.  This allows you to style your pages and blog posts whichever way you'd prefer.  These "layout" files should exist in the "_layouts" folder for your site template.  The site template is a set of files and folders that Sandra.Snow uses to produce the final static website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "category" or "categories" property, you can use both for singular or multiple comma-seperated values that refer to the category/categories of your blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "title" should hopefully be self explanatory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can optionally add an author and email properties to override the global config settings for example, if you wanted to allow guest author blog posts.  There is also an optional metadescription property you can use for SEO.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Global Config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the root of the site template is a snow.config file which is what Sandra.Snow uses to determine url format, where to look for posts and layouts and other related information. It is JSON formatted and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "blogTitle" : "Joe Bloggs Blog",
  "author" : "Mr.Guest",
  "email" : "guest@gmail.com",
  "siteUrl": "http://blog.joebloggs.com",
  "posts": "Snow/_posts",
  "layouts": "Snow/_layouts",
  "output": "../MYRelativeWebsiteFolder",
  "urlFormat": "yyyy/MM/dd/slug",
  "copyDirectories": [
    "Snow/images =&amp;gt; images",
    "Snow/js =&amp;gt; js",
    "Snow/css =&amp;gt; css"
  ],
  "processFiles": [{
    "file": "Snow/index.cshtml",
    "loop": "Posts"
  },{
    "file": "Snow/category.cshtml",
    "loop": "Categories"
  },{
    "file": "Snow/categories.cshtml =&amp;gt; categories"
  },{
    "file": "Snow/archive.cshtml =&amp;gt; archive"
  },{
    "file": "Snow/about.cshtml =&amp;gt; about"
  },{
    "file": "Snow/contact.cshtml =&amp;gt; contact"
  },{
    "file": "feed.xml",
    "loop": "RSS"
  },{
    "file": "sitemap.xml",
    "loop": "sitemap"
  }]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"blogTitle" : The title of the blog you want to appear on your RSS feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"author" : The author's name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"email" : The author's email.(You can use an &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/wiki/Gravatar-Support"&gt;HTMLHelper&lt;/a&gt; in the view that gets the author's Gravatar from the global/post settings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"siteUrl": "This is used to enable Disqus support. Simply use an &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/wiki/Disqus-Support"&gt;HTMLHelper&lt;/a&gt; to render Disqus comments"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"posts" : The location of the markdown files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"layouts" : The location of the layout files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"output" : The location where Sandra.Snow will put the static HTML. This is relative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"urlFormat" : The format of the URL to your blog post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"copyDirectories" : The directories in your template that it will copy to the output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"processFiles" : This takes an object of the filename and property information on how to render the file.  Each file/view will be called and rendered with model information availble.  The model information available to these views are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public List&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; PostsInCategory { get; set; }
public Dictionary&amp;lt;int, Dictionary&amp;lt;int, List&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PostsGroupedByYearThenMonth { get; set; }
public List&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; Posts { get; set; }
public List&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; PostsPaged { get; set; }


public bool HasPreviousPage { get; set; }
public bool HasNextPage { get; set; }
public int NextPage { get; set; }
public int PreviousPage { get; set; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard website template there are category, categories, about and index *.cshtml pages which accept this model information and render the relevant information. Based on the file name you can guess what each file outputs.  The "loop" in the settings is used internally by Sandra.Snow to process the relevant data. For example "RSS" creates a RSS file based on the list of posts while Posts/Categories create sub-directories for the relevant model type eg/categories/posts.  "sitemap" will use the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create a sitemap.xml in the root of your blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sandra.Snow is a static HTML generator it will create folders with the relevant name for the post or file named in the config file eg/&lt;code&gt;http://mydomain.com/2013/08/18/this-is-a-great-article&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://mydomain.com/categories&lt;/code&gt; and create a &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file for each folder.  In the root of the website it will create a &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; with 10 blog posts inside it.  If you have 100 markdown posts it will it will page this for you and create links to &lt;code&gt;http://mydomain.com/page2&lt;/code&gt; etc.  If you use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--excerpt--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your Markdown it will read up to that point so you can click a "read more" link otherwise it will use the whole Markdown content.    If you look at the model properties you'll see your index layout view can tell if there is a next/previous page and therefore create the relevant links in the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you run the Sandra.Snow exe it will output the HTML and you can then FTP your files to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/wiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for more details about other HTMLHelpers such as Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Git Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTP is so 2001 so Sandra.Snow has a website called Sandra.Snow.Barbato which allows you to access it (final URL to be confirmed) and log in with your Github credentials.  It will then give you a list of your repositories, the idea being one of them is your blog with the markdown posts and snow.config etc.  A &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow.BarbatoTemplate"&gt;base template&lt;/a&gt; is available in the Sandra repository for you to fork.  You can then choose whether you'd like to deploy to another Git repository that supports Git deployment eg/Azure, AppHarbor, Heroku or you can select FTP.  In either scenario, enter your details and off you go. The website will use Sandra.Snow to create the output and it will then wire it over to your chosen destination.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandra.Snow.Barbato is also setup to handle Github hooks so in Github if you tell your repository to do a post commit hook to the website, after you write a new blog post and push to Github it will post to the website and know if you've previously logged in and if so generate the HTML and re-deploy your blog.  It will also push the generated content back to your Github repository on the master branch. Very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting up Sandra.Snow.Barbato&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One you have forked the Barbato template you can begin to style your blog pages.  Obviously every time you want to make a style change you want to see the results.  There are 2 ways to do this.  i) Run Sandra.Snow locally, setup a webserver eg/IISExpress to point to the Snow output directory and open up your browser to see the changes. Keep making changes to the *.cshtml and *.css files until happy ii) Make the changes in your repo, sign up with Sandra.Snow.Barbato and go to your domain to check the changes that were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Azure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deploying to Azure you must have a .deployment file in the root of your repository that contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[config]
project = Website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is needed because when your template repository is pushed to Azure it needs to know what to deploy. This simply tells it to use the Website folder ie.the output folder from Sandra.Snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Github Pages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deploying to Github you need a few things. Your repository needs to be called &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. You then need to create a CNAME file in your repo that has the domain you will be using inside it. Finally you need to setup the DNS on your domain to point to &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; by creating a CNAME record in your DNS Manager. What you'll have to probably do is clone your &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo and run Snow and set the output setting in snow.config to the path of your &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; folder. You can then push the changes to Github. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wordpress Migration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog was previously using Wordpress so I needed to get my data out.  The most common referred to tool was &lt;a href="https://github.com/dreikanter/wp2md"&gt;wp2md&lt;/a&gt; which uses Python to go through the exported Wordpress content and then convert to Markdown.  For some reason I didn't go with that choice and went with &lt;a href="http://heckyesmarkdown.com/"&gt;http://heckyesmarkdown.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  Its a bit more work because you have to give it your previous URLs to your blog posts and it reads the source of the page and converts it to Markdown.  It worked brilliantly for me.  I had to make a few changes on the output it provided by generally it was very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I didn't want to worry about HTTP 302, I made sure I saved my markdown files as the urls are on my live site so &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/12/19/why-use-nancyfx/"&gt;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/12/19/why-use-nancyfx/&lt;/a&gt; was saved in a file called &lt;code&gt;2012-12-19-why-use-nancyfx.md&lt;/code&gt;. This file naming format is currently enforced so Snow can gather date and slug information(unsafe characters in the slug/title for URLs will be removed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went through addind the meta headers to tell Sandra.Snow a bit more about the posts and also added in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--excerpt--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; information so not to render the whole blog content on the home pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went through and styled the master page &lt;code&gt;default.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; in the _layouts folder as well as the &lt;code&gt;post.cshtml&lt;/code&gt; and the other files in the root of the site template folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done I ran the .exe file to generate my content.  One of the great things about Sandra.Snow is its speed. It takes less than a second to do 100 blog posts, luckily I only have 25 so its really fast.  I opened up a browser and checked my files and if some styling needed tweaking I could do so and re-run.  Once all ok I can deploy or push the template folder to Github, setup the post commit hook and then use Sandra.Snow.Barbato to handle deployment from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a Git and Markdown user and want to create a blog with complete simplicity this is a great tool.  No more messy Wordpress, no more running exe's on your machine (unless you want to), its completely automated apart from writing the blog posts!  In fact I'm so happy with this project, this blog is using it!  Give it a try and if you like the look of it get involved with its development.  &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt; the new modern, simplistic and effective tool for blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tidier way to do the above where you can return specific objects and its called &lt;code&gt;ReturnsLazily&lt;/code&gt;.  Lets take a look at this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public interface IEmployeeRepository
{
    Employee GetEmployeeById(int id);
}

public class App
{
    private readonly IEmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    public App(IEmployeeRepository employeeRepository)
    {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
    }

    public string GetNamesAsCsv(int[] ids)
    {
        var employees = ids.Select(id =&amp;gt; employeeRepository.GetEmployeeById(id).Name);
        return string.Join(",", employees);
    }
}

public class AppTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void AppReturnsNamesAsCsv()
    {
        //Given
        var employees = new Dictionary&amp;lt;int, Employee&amp;gt;
        {
            { 1, new Employee { Name = "Moss"} },
            { 2, new Employee { Name = "Roy"} },
        };

        var fakeRepository = A.Fake&amp;lt;IEmployeeRepository&amp;gt;();
        A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; fakeRepository.GetEmployeeById(A&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;.Ignored))
            .ReturnsLazily&amp;lt;Employee, int&amp;gt;(id =&amp;gt; employees[id]);

        var app = new App(fakeRepository);

        //When
        var result = app.GetNamesAsCsv(employees.Keys.ToArray());

        //Then
        Assert.Equal("Moss,Roy", result);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; object, a &lt;code&gt;IEmployeeRepository&lt;/code&gt; which returns an &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; object and an App that returns a CSV.  We then want to test this and make sure we get back a CSV from multiple objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we set our fake setup and say that when &lt;code&gt;GetEmployeeById&lt;/code&gt; is called we want to return a specific object.  Our App class will call &lt;code&gt;GetEmployeeById&lt;/code&gt; twice with the id of 1 and 2.  This is done by passing in &lt;code&gt;employees.Keys.ToArray()&lt;/code&gt; to our GetNamesAsCsv method under test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this is called with the id we want to return specific objects &lt;code&gt;.ReturnsLazily&amp;lt;Employee, int&amp;gt;(id =&amp;gt; employees[id]);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This says we want to return an Employee and the argument in the repository call is an int.  We can then use that to return a specific object based on that id which is where the &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;int, Employee&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; comes in handy.  Based on the key it will return either an Employee called Moss or Roy.  Our &lt;code&gt;GetNamesAsCsv&lt;/code&gt; will then join Moss &amp;amp; Roy together as a CSV and we can assert that our method works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps someone!&lt;/p&gt;

I was getting an error saying that it needed the endpoint to accept Access-Control-Allow-Origin requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went Googling and it couldn't find anything specific to IIS Express but managed to use some guidance for full blown IIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to go to &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express\AppServer&lt;/code&gt; and open the &lt;code&gt;applicationhost.config&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;httpProtocol&lt;/code&gt; and you should see this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;httpProtocol&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;customHeaders&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;clear /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;add name="X-Powered-By" value="ASP.NET" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/customHeaders&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;redirectHeaders&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;clear /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/redirectHeaders&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/httpProtocol&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now add this to the &lt;code&gt;customHeaders&lt;/code&gt; node:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="Content-Type" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just bear in mind this opens up your webserver so you may need to find something alternative for a live production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway you should now be able to start accepting requests via CORS when you fire up IISExpress&lt;/p&gt;

I tend to stick with a naming convention such as MainApp, MainApp.Tests.Unit &amp;amp; MainApp.Tests.Integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had begun writing my integration tests for a repository that hits the database and returns data. Currently it was one method being called in the repository.  &lt;a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/"&gt;xUnit&lt;/a&gt; allows you to setup any test dependencies in the constructor of your test class.  It also allows you to do any tidying up in a Dispose method if you implement IDisposable although this is &lt;a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Comparisons&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home#note2"&gt;frowned upon&lt;/a&gt;.  However I felt for my needs I would implement this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  was creating data in the database in the constructor which will get called before the test runs, retrieving data in the test, asserting and then deleting all data and resetting the auto-incrementing from the tables in the Dispose method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was working perfectly until I wanted to test another method on my repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now needed to add data for my new method but realised if I added different data to the database in the constructor, I would be creating unnecessary data unrelated to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My options were to move the constructor logic into separate methods and then call the methods in the test or have separate test classes per method in the repo.  Both were a not an ideal solution and quite frankly verbose, ugly and not best practice.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing with the attributes on my tests to see if xUnit offered me something and was chuffed to find the &lt;code&gt;BeforeAfterTestAttribute&lt;/code&gt;.  This does exactly what it says on the tin.  Its an abstract class that you inherit from for your own implementation and overide the &lt;code&gt;Before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;After&lt;/code&gt; methods;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class RepoMethod1BeforeAfter : BeforeAfterTestAttribute
{
    public override void After(MethodInfo methodUnderTest)
    {
      //Insert data into tables
    }

    public override void Before(MethodInfo methodUnderTest)
    {
      //Drop data from tables
    }
}

[Fact]
[RepoMethod1BeforeAfter]
public void RepoMethod1_Should_be_Awesome()
{
  //Check it's awesome
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then put an attribute on the relevant tests that need to have specific data inserted/deleted and it keeps the design of your test class follow best practices as well as not implementing IDisposable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can spot as a slight issue is remembering to put the attribute on your tests but I think that'll be quite obvious when your tests start failing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of a test with Nancy looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You set up a bootstrapper, this can be your live one or an inherited version of your live one with dependencies changed to mocks for example or use the &lt;code&gt;ConfigurableBootstrapper&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my scenario I was testing that when a route got called something on an interface was called with an instance of an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the object available in the test, I passed it to my fake interface and asserted that the call happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what the route and test might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class ApiModule : NancyModule
{
    public ApiModule(IScheduleRepository scheduleRepository)
        : base("/api/schedules")
    {
        Post["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt;
        {
            var result = this.BindAndValidate&amp;lt;Schedule&amp;gt;();

            if (!ModelValidationResult.IsValid)
            {
                return HttpStatusCode.UnprocessableEntity;
            }

            var conflict = scheduleRepository.CheckForConflict(result);

            return HttpStatusCode.Created;
        };
    }
}

[Fact]
public void Creating_Schedule_Entry_Should_Check_For_Conflicts()
{
    //Given
    var fakeScheduleRepository = A.Fake&amp;lt;IScheduleRepository&amp;gt;();
    var model = GetModel();

    var browser = new Browser(GetBootstrapper(scheduleRepository:fakeScheduleRepository));

    //When
    var result = browser.Post("/api/schedules", with =&amp;gt;
    {
        with.HttpRequest();
        with.JsonBody(model);
    });

    //Then
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; fakeScheduleRepository.CheckForConflict(model)).MustHaveHappened();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test is using &lt;a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/"&gt;xUnit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/FakeItEasy/FakeItEasy"&gt;FakeItEasy&lt;/a&gt; for creating fakes/mocks or whatever you choose to call them and the test will pass if the call to &lt;code&gt;fakeScheduleRepository.CheckForConflict&lt;/code&gt; was called with the model object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The test fails!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the test failing is because...? That's right, the object that is passed into the call on IScheduleRepository in the route is different to the one in the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could override Equals on our model object but that's not a great approach, we could hope that if we create an &lt;code&gt;IEqualityComparer&amp;lt;Schedule&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; we could pass that in somewhere but from what I've seen that's not possible so how do we get our test to pass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FakeItEasy has a nice fluent API that allows you to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Fact]
public void Creating_Schedule_Entry_Should_Check_For_Conflicts()
{
    //Given
    var fakeScheduleRepository = A.Fake&amp;lt;IScheduleRepository&amp;gt;();
    var model = GetModel();

    var browser = new Browser(GetBootstrapper(scheduleRepository:fakeScheduleRepository));

    //When
    var result = browser.Post("/api/schedules", with =&amp;gt;
    {
        with.HttpRequest();
        with.JsonBody(model);
    });

    //Then
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; fakeScheduleRepository.CheckForConflict(A&amp;lt;Schedule&amp;gt;.That.Matches(x =&amp;gt; BodyModel(x)))).MustHaveHappened();
}

private bool BodyModel(CreateKeywordSchedule match)
{
    return match.DateFrom == new DateTime(2013, 01, 01, 12, 00, 00) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
           match.DateTo == new DateTime(2013, 01, 02, 12, 00, 00);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot the difference? So instead of passing our original model object in we told FakeItEasy to expect a type of Schedule that matches an an object that is of type Schedule.  We wrote a &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;Schedule,bool&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to determine what a match is when comparing objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the test runs and &lt;code&gt;fakeScheduleRepository.CheckForConflict(model)&lt;/code&gt; is executed FakeItEasy will assert that the argument passed into &lt;code&gt;fakeScheduleRepository.CheckForConflict()&lt;/code&gt; matches the property values we decided to match on in our BodyModel method.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way if the model we send into the route has the property values that match those we have defined in BodyModel we can pass our test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a much neater way without having to write &lt;code&gt;IEqualityComparer&lt;/code&gt; or anything over the top and hope you found this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be argued that only "use asynchronicity in a web framework if you expect high traffic in your web application". If you only have 10 requests on a small site you're not going to benefit from asynchronous execution as there are plenty of threads available to handle your application.  If you start hitting 1000 concurrent requests (the default IIS limit) then requests will start getting queued up.  If you make your routes asynchronous then any code that is being waited on, the thread that is being used there can be released to process another request thus speeding up the performance of your app and prevent the likely hood of large queues.  I will show how simple it is to make your routes asynchronous with Nancy below.&lt;/p&gt;

I will show how simple it is to make your routes asynchronous with Nancy below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Async with Nancy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 4.5 the way to do asynchronous execution simplified the previous approaches in .NET.  Having asynchronous execution within a web framework these days seems to be a "must have" so the Nancy team got their freak on (mainly &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grumpydev"&gt;@grumpydev&lt;/a&gt;) and enabled async/await within Nancy.  Its codebase has been kept backward compatible with .NET 4.0 but has been enabled to use the .NET 4.5 &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;, pretty impressive! In fact it uses its own version of &lt;code&gt;ContinueWith&lt;/code&gt; as the default one was considered not quick enough along with other &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460717.aspx"&gt;TPL&lt;/a&gt; optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the synchronous version of returning "Hello World":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SampleModule : Nancy.NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; "Hello World!";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to make this &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; (although we wouldn't as there is no I/O and we wouldn't see any benefit) we would change it to look this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SampleModule : Nancy.NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get["/", true] = async (parameters, ct) =&amp;gt; "Hello World!";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple and elegant hey?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's going on you say?  Well the boolean of "true" on the request path tells Nancy that the request is marked as asynchronous.  We can then mark the route as &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; as you would any &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; method and the delegate of the route now takes and additional &lt;code&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/code&gt; along with the captured parameters.  If you wanted you could use named parameters and define your route like so: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SampleModule : Nancy.NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get["/", runAsync:true] = async (parameters, ct) =&amp;gt; "Hello World!";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/code&gt; is passed in so you can check the &lt;code&gt;ct.IsCancellationRequested&lt;/code&gt; property to determine if you want to cooperatively cancel processing in your route handler.  This property may be set for example if there is an internal error or if a piece of middleware decides to cancel the request, or the host is shutting down. If you didn't know Nancy is OWIN compliant and has been pretty much since the OWIN specification came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Demo Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated above, returning "Hello World" from an asynchronous route is pointless so we need something I/O bound to demonstrate a bit better how we would use async/await in an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine we are one of those types that love QR codes and we need to generate one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class IndexModule : NancyModule
{
    public IndexModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; View["Index"];

        Post["/", true] = async (x, ct) =&amp;gt;
        {
            var link = await GetQrCode(ct);
            var model = new { QrPath = link };
            return View["Index", model];
        };
    }

    private async Task&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; GetQrCode(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var client = new HttpClient();
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-Mashape-Authorization", "oEzDRdFudTpsuLtmgewrIGcuj08tK7PI");
        var response = await client.GetAsync(
                "https://mutationevent-qr-code-generator.p.mashape.com/generate.php?content=http://www.nancyfx.org&amp;amp;type=url"
                , ct);

        var stringContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        dynamic model = JsonObject.Parse(stringContent);

        return model["image_url"];
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have a GET that returns a view and then an async POST that &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;'s a &lt;code&gt;GetQrCode&lt;/code&gt; method that returns a &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; depending on how you interpret that specific .NET 4.5 behaviour.  At this point the thread can be used to process another request whilst it waits to be notified that &lt;code&gt;GetQrCode&lt;/code&gt; has finished.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GetQrCode&lt;/code&gt; method uses a &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; to execute an API call to get a QR code which will link to http://www.nancyfx.org.  Our method will then return the location of the QR code image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything marked with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; needs an &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; otherwise it will just execute synchronously.  In our method we execute an asynchronous call (just like our async route) to the API so we &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; it and once we do we &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; reading the response as &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and then parse the JSON content to a dynamic type.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We return a string from the method but the compiler will actually convert that to a &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"An await expression does not block the thread on which it is executing. Instead, it causes the compiler to sign up the rest of the async method as a continuation on the awaited task. Control then returns to the caller of the async method. When the task completes, it invokes its continuation, and execution of the async method resumes where it left off."&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh156528.aspx"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;code&gt;GetQrCode&lt;/code&gt; returns we set up a simple anonymous type with a QrPath property that is set to the result of &lt;code&gt;GetQrCode&lt;/code&gt; and we return our view.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view we then have some code that determines when to show the QR image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@if (Model != null)
{
    &amp;lt;img alt="QR Code" src="Model.QrPath"/&amp;gt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view this code as a running application in my Github repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/Nancy.Demo.Async"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Guts of it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a bit more of an understanding how &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; works in Nancy then lets take a look at the code below that is located in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/blob/master/src/Nancy/Routing/DefaultRouteInvoker.cs"&gt;DefaultRouteInvoker&lt;/a&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Task&amp;lt;Response&amp;gt; Invoke(Route route, CancellationToken cancellationToken, DynamicDictionary parameters, NancyContext context)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource&amp;lt;Response&amp;gt;();

    var result = route.Invoke(parameters, cancellationToken);

    result.WhenCompleted(
       completedTask =&amp;gt;
        {
            var returnResult = completedTask.Result;
            ...
        }
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our route that we are executing is invoked and as we know from above the captured parameters on the route eg/customer/{id} and a CancellationToken is passed in.  We can then see the customized &lt;code&gt;ContinueWith&lt;/code&gt; known as &lt;code&gt;WhenCompleted&lt;/code&gt; is setup to resolve what our route returns be that a view or data.  So as we know when using async we need to return a &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (you can return void and have a method marked as &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; but those should only be used for fire-and-forget methods like event handlers) and in our routes case it returns a Task&lt;Nancy.Responses.Negotiation.Negotiator&gt;.  The DefaultRouteInvoker then carries on to do its thing getting ready to render a view or serialize our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there's the scope of async/await in Nancy, all the goodies of Nancy still apply now with the addition of asynchronous routes.  If you have read this blog post and not used Nancy before please read &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/12/19/why-use-nancyfx/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; which reminds me I need to add "ASYNC ALL THE THINGS" to the list of reasons to use Nancy!&lt;/p&gt;

I have a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde situation going on that I need to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw Visual Node it appeared to my statically typed side. "Ooooh, proper debugging, this looks interesting".  So I signed up to be kept up to date when they were ready for beta testers and yesterday I got my email saying I could download a private beta version and give it a whirl. So that's what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over to their &lt;a href="http://www.visualnode.info/readme"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; page which explained how to install it and some of the features.  I installed a VSIX which gives me a project template to choose from when creating a project in Visual Studio(VS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.visualnode.info/images/readme/new-project.png" alt="Project Template" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting this gives you a basic http server app template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/projectlayout.PNG" alt="Project Layout" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that they have tried to bring a &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/"&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; style dialog for searching packages in &lt;a href="https://npmjs.org/"&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.visualnode.info/images/readme/package.png" alt="NPM Picture" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings a sense of familiarity to Visual Studio users which is great. It orders its results alphabetically. I found the searching a bit slow but I'm not sure if that's down to my internet connection or how NPM handles searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code in the template is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Load the http module to create an http server.
var http = require('http');

// Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    response.end("Hello World\n");
});

// Listen on port 8000, IP defaults to 127.0.0.1
server.listen(8000);

// Put a friendly message on the terminal
console.log("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then pressed F5 to see what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fires up a console app and a browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/console.png" alt="Console" /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/helloworldbrowser.PNG" alt="Browser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went back to Visual Studio and put a breakpoint on the &lt;code&gt;response.end("Hello World\n");"&lt;/code&gt; to see what would happen when I refreshed my browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/debugging.png" alt="Debugging" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stopped on the breakpoint and gives me information about the objects in scope etc and let me step into the current line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/f11.png" alt="F11" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty basic hello world style of seeing what Visual Node can do but that static language side of me really likes the look of this and the potential it can bring. I believe &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm"&gt;WebStorm&lt;/a&gt; also provides node.js debugging so check that out but for pure familiarity reasons I like the look of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better understanding here's a video:&lt;/p&gt;

Assuming no-one has a copy of your code changes you can go back and modify the files at a certain point in time within your commit history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Git Bash by default but the editor sucks compared to Sublime Text so first things first lets setup the Git editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sublime Text run this in the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe'"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is finding the commit id you want to go back to, to edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a note of the parent commit id of the commit you want to edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Git Bash by default but the editor sucks compared to Sublime Text so first things first lets setup the Git editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sublime Text run this in the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe'"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is finding the commit id you want to go back to, to edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a note of the parent commit id of the commit you want to edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --interactive 1185cb0de5d5e5b4c79f83a0c51ed06a5d22d7c4^
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will open Sublime Text and you’ll see lines similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pick d3adb33 My Commit message
pick d5bdb67 Other Commit message
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change “pick” to “edit” on the commit you want to modify, save and exit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then make the changes to your files and when ready run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit --all --amend
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text will open again so you can edit the commit message, just save, exit and run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your previous commit has been amended and you’re back to where you were with the latest commits ready to be pushed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft .Net and C#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot a pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets point out the obvious, the operating system, the frameworks, the language, the tooling and the data storage are all owned and implemented by one company (and they say Apple tries to lock its users in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a vicious circle here, MS provide the full stack and companies feel comfortable with this as MS are a large company and therefore must be reliable. They also believe they have someone to shout at or sue if things go wrong and someone to call for support if they get stuck. Remind me what is the direct phone number to speak to someone about the issue I’m having with my LINQ statement or asynchronous method? You don’t have one you use Stackoverflow? Intersting. The circles continues as developers learn this stack to get jobs and recruiters are instructed to find people that list the MS items on their CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This circle only happens in .Net. Lets look at other frameworks and tools for another language that implement similar things in the tech list that companies are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating System&lt;/strong&gt; : Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framework&lt;/strong&gt;: node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Framework&lt;/strong&gt; : express.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt; : JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooling&lt;/strong&gt; : Sublime Text or WebStorm or Notepad++or [insert many others]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Storage&lt;/strong&gt; : PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORM&lt;/strong&gt;: node-postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINQ&lt;/strong&gt; : linq.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Services&lt;/strong&gt; : restify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot a pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are all completely independent from each other and there are more than one option for each that are more than acceptable. Acceptable being the keyword. If I write the same list for alternative frameworks/libraries/tooling for .Net this is what you end up with but the question is are they acceptable to the majority of companies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating System&lt;/strong&gt; : Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Framework&lt;/strong&gt; : Nancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooling&lt;/strong&gt;: Xamarin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORM&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple.Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Services&lt;/strong&gt;: Service Stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying companies have to chuck out Windows and Visual Studio (from my own experience Visual Studio is better than Xamarin) but at least be aware of them, the same goes for developers. These alternative frameworks and libraries may offer something a lot better than what MS give you but if you don’t look you won’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issues is getting companies/developers to look. People have said to me in the past that why should I bother learning ‘X’ if I can’t get a job in it or whatever the majority of developers use I will stick with that. I can understand where they are coming from because if companies only want to employ people that use libraries that are MS owned there is no incentive for them even if they offer better performance or solutions. These kind of attitudes of are in turn effecting community events in that the talks are often MS based and those in the community that put forward talks on alternative approaches are not getting enough votes to make the cut because people want to learn the MS stuff as they feel it will keep them secure in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only solution of breaking the vicious circle is for companies to change their attitudes in terms of tooling, frameworks and libraries that they use. Microsoft recently made a change to their &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/open-source"&gt;OSS page&lt;/a&gt; which now lists alternative web frameworks on the .Net framework which is great and thanks to Scott Hanselman for doing this. This helps educate those developers/companies that are MS facing because now they have a bit more exposure to alternative/better libraries. In turn this may hopefully help companies realise that there are alternative libraries that are not one man bands and likely to disappear overnight and do offer better ways of providing solutions to their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the answer to why .Net should become independent. You are not tied to one company for all your resources. You can adopt many other libraries and tools better than MS provided ones and allow the frameworks, tooling, libraries and community to become more feature rich with alternatives. The more ideas/projects out there which are used will inspire more projects which may provide better solutions. I can already here people saying “that’s crazy, at least if we follow MS we only have one thing to learn”. My response “Are you sheep, can you not make your own mind up?”. Take a look at some of the alternatives and see if you like it and see if it solves a problem, if it doesn’t fair enough but at least you looked and tried. I believe its a developer’s responsibility to push for “change”, to open eyes and widen opinions on the non-MS stuff although there is a balancing act to use all the new shiny stuff as you don’t want to get burnt but need to use new libraries otherwise you will never know. This is part of continual learning and progress and writing spikes to see if things fit. I’m not saying that if you go off and write your own library it will automatically get main stream adoption because there can only be a handful of great libraries trying to solve the same problem but if they exist and there is no restriction for you as a developer/company you may actually gain by looking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a open minded developer and not a MS facing developer I have found myself having to learn the technologies on the list of what recruiters want as well as learn other libraries that interest me and provide better solutions. This is the way of the alternative .Net developer but its a pain the ass. If recruiters started advertising experience for Nancy, Simple.Data and ServiceStack it would make our lives easier! Will the attitude change I speak of happen overnight? Probably not, its been going on for years. Should I wait for the culture change or move languages? You would think that I should change language if I’m not happy with the culture of the MS stack but I enjoy C# and .Net and I enjoy using the OSS projects out there, its just when looking for jobs I need to find a company that is willing to look at new libraries and not just Microsoft’s approach. This is very hard to do unless you are in London. Companies there have changed their attitudes and are more open to using alternative libraries and do advertise for people with experience in the alternative libraries but for the rest of the UK they mostly remain MS orientated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the spanner in the works, the available jobs for Python, JVM languages or node.js are virtually non-existent so whilst as much as I bitch and moan that companies should look at MS alternatives I pretty much have to deal with it because the majority of jobs are for .Net with a MS stack. I could go the way of my friend mentioned earlier and work for myself writing software in using the tech/tooling I want but what if I run out of contracts and need to get back into the job market? I will face the same issue as he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect job out there regardless of tech/tools used (if you say you have it then you are either a liar or very very lucky) which is something I have recently accepted but if the majority of jobs are on the MS stack and there are great alternative .Net projects waiting to be discovered can we please ask our companies to open their eyes and take a look at what else might be out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this is no easy feat with MVC (with Nancy its all &lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Testing-your-application"&gt;done for you&lt;/a&gt;) and you have to mock a lot of things. I’m hoping that in later releases this will be fixed because I know that ASP.Net Web API has made things a bit easier for testing (and wrote a testing library for it) so I assume the two projects will use bits of each other or their roadmap will merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that there a quite a lot of samples with Moq but nothing for Fake It Easy(FIE) so I checked in at the &lt;a href="https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/fakeiteasy"&gt;FIE Jabbr room&lt;/a&gt; and got some help and worked through some ideas and below is the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Controller
public class MyController : Controller
{
    [HttpPost]
    public void Index()
    {
        Response.Write("This is fiddly");
        Response.Flush();
    }
}

//Unit Test
[Fact]
public void Should_contain_fiddly_in_response()
{
    var sb = new StringBuilder();

    var formCollection = new NameValueCollection();
    formCollection.Add("MyPostedData", "Boo");

    var request = A.Fake&amp;lt;HttpRequestBase&amp;gt;();
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; request.HttpMethod).Returns("POST");
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; request.Headers).Returns(new NameValueCollection());
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; request.Form).Returns(formCollection);
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; request.QueryString).Returns(new NameValueCollection());

    var response = A.Fake&amp;lt;HttpResponseBase&amp;gt;();
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; response.Write(A&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;.Ignored)).Invokes((string x) =&amp;gt; sb.Append(x));

    var mockHttpContext = A.Fake&amp;lt;HttpContextBase&amp;gt;();
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; mockHttpContext.Request).Returns(request);
    A.CallTo(() =&amp;gt; mockHttpContext.Response).Returns(response);

    var controllerContext = new ControllerContext(mockHttpContext, new RouteData(), A.Fake&amp;lt;ControllerBase&amp;gt;());

    var myController = GetController();
    myController.ControllerContext = controllerContext;


    myController.Index();

    Assert.Contains("fiddly", sb.ToString());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are not running this against a live web server we need to mock everything from base controller types to requests, responses and everything in between. My example initiates a bit more than is required ie. querystring and headers but hopefully it demonstrates what’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly we create an instance of a StringBuilderthat will store the response information that we can assert against. We setup a NameValueCollection to add keys/values for posted data, we could do the same for headers etc if we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then create an instance of a fake HttpRequestBase using FIE and setup all the relevant request properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then create an instance of a fake HttpResponseBase and configure a callback that is invoked when our controller calls Response.Write. We also configure it to watch any calls to Response.Write with any string using the FIE syntax of A.Ignored, you could change it so it only looks for specific argument contents if you wanted. When the method is called it then takes the argument and adds it to the StringBuilder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then create a fake instance of HttpContextBase and assign the properties of Request and Response to the previously setup fakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then have to create a ControllerContext and pass the fake Http context, a route collection and a fake ControllerBase which the controller under test inherits off. We then assign the controller context to an instance of the controller class we are testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now finally call the method under test and assert the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would obviously recommend you put the fake setup in a factory method if you have multiple tests you class to prevent duplication. You can obviously then add header, querystring, form method arguments if you want the context populated with that kind of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps anyone in a similar situation and provides a point of reference for the Fake It Easy project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went over to TypeScript’s &lt;a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and followed the Hello World type code examples under the “Learn” tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went over to TypeScript’s &lt;a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and followed the Hello World type code examples under the “Learn” tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the basics of it and wanting to learn more I spotted this demo code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Student {
    fullname : string;
    constructor(public firstname, public middleinitial, public lastname) {
        this.fullname = firstname %2B " " %2B middleinitial %2B " " %2B lastname;
    }
}

interface Person {
    firstname: string;
    lastname: string;
}

function greeter(person : Person) {
    return "Hello, " %2B person.firstname %2B " " %2B person.lastname;
}

var user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User");

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interface that expects public properties of firstname and lastname. There is a Student class that has a constructor with arguments for firstname, middleinitial and lastname. TypeScript constructor arguments are shorthand for making the arguments properties on the object itself without having to code all that yourself. We then have a function called greeter that takes a method argument of our Person interface and uses the properties of it to return a string. We then create a new instance of the Student class and then call the greeter function with our instance. Woooaaahhh! I want static typing, WTF is going on here? Essentially TypeScript allows for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"&gt;Duck Typing&lt;/a&gt; where any object that makes calls to or uses properties that match another type, it will allow. Now technically you can do this in C# by using the “dynamic” keyword but I would still keep and one to one mapping even if it was dynamic/duck typed so not to confuse future users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be this example that I don’t like where properties are being un-used or the fact that the keyword “interface” is being used and the class is not statically implementing it but I guess this is how TypeScript uses interfaces ie/duck typing. I can’t think of a reason why you’d have an object that exposes properties that are not used when they have been shoe horned/duck typed into another with fewer properties etc, however, this might just be my statically typed mind not liking it and it should chill and get with the dynamic nature of things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Webstorm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in my quest to develop something on my Mac I chose Webstorm as my IDE. I haven’t heard one bad thing against Jetbrains so it must be good right? Must be simple and intuitive? Ummm, no. Webstorm has support for TypeScript and uses the computer’s version of TypeScript to compile *.ts files into *.js files. So I installed Node.js and TypeScript (&lt;em&gt;npm install -g typescript&lt;/em&gt;) and fired up Webstorm. Webstorm offers various project types to create new projects from but unfortunately no TypeScript one so I created an empty application. I added a *.ts file and Webstorm spots that this is a TypeScript file and wants to add a File Watcher. This means every time a change is made it recompiles in the background to produce *.js, that seems a bit keen for my liking and would prefer it on every time the file is saved but each to their own. I copied the above code into my my *.ts file. I then created a html file and referenced the JavaScript file that was created from the TypeScript compilation in the head section. (I’m using the term compilation but I guess it should be transpiling but you know what I’m getting at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, we’re ready to go and debug and here comes the confusion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being used to Visual Studio I thought it would start a web server instance up, open my system browser and away we go but unfortunately not. I was baffled but that doesn’t take much! I found the Run menu item and it had a Debug option and it then popped up window with a Edit Configuration option so I clicked that and it came up with the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/WebstormDebug-620x390.png" alt="WebStorm Debug" title="Webstorm Debug" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there was no TypeScript option I assumed JavaScript was the option to go with. Under this option it has Local and Remote menu items to choose from. If you look at Local it autofills a path to the index.html on the filesystem, under the Remote option it shows the project structure and asks for a URL. I tried localhost:1234 but nothing so I went back to the filesystem option and clicked Apply but that doesn’t actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So went through it all again and saw the + icon in the screenshot and it gives you an option to add a JavaScript configuration and is a complete mirror of the above screenshot. Very odd. Clicked Apply, then tried to Debug again and it gave me the configuration I chose and then opened Chrome. Nothing. WTF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a rummage around WebStorm and saw a note about needing a Jetbrains Chrome extension to debug. So off to the Chrome Store I went and installed the plugin. Tried to Debug and it now opened a browser with my page so things are looking good. Went to the TypeScript file and put a breakpoint on a line but it wasn’t getting hit. I then put a breakpoint on a line in the JavaScript file and it got hit. Yay! But no content was in my page. Baffled again. WebStorm was saying that it couldn’t set the innerHTML property of null. Eh? How can a body be null? After a while of head scratching I sussed it. Those of you that are eagle eyed will have spotted that I put the script declaration in my head and therefore when it got executed there was no such thing as a body tag in the DOM yet. So I moved the script declaration to the body and bingo we have content. I should know better and should have put the script tag at the bottom of the body anyway but this was just a “Hello World” app so wasn’t too worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway it now works and either I’m too entrenched in Visual Studio and should learn to adapt to new IDE’s or I expect things to just work without having to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM"&gt;RTFM&lt;/a&gt;. I must say if I have to read the manual on how to use pieces of software you have an instant fail however, as I’ve heard such great things about Jetbrains and Webstorm I’m willing to give it another go but it has me on the back foot already. I’m also still unsure how to set WebStorm up to use a local web server because debugging by pointing to a file system seems wrong, if anyone knows please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone else to get up and running with TypeScript and WebStorm, if not I’m sure there are plenty who’ve had a laugh from this article asking how one person can be so dumb :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don’t know what Markdown is, its essentially a shorter/cleaner syntax that can be parsed to produce HTML. Below are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see more examples in the earlier link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re writing a blog post or a lengthy page in your web app with lots of HTML it maybe easier to use Markdown as your preferred syntax. I currently use WordPress for my blog, it’s ok but its quite bloated for probably what I need. I looked into &lt;a href="http://calepin.co/"&gt;Calepin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scriptogr.am/"&gt;Scriptogr.am&lt;/a&gt; as alternative blogging platforms but I felt it didn’t quite offer what I wanted but the approach was a good idea. It meant you could write a blog post and simply put the file in dropbox and it would appear on your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware, I’m a great fan of &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; and the team/contributors were discussing having something similar to Calepin for Nancy so users could upload a Markdown file as a pull request or community article or have something that uses Markdown that can be plugged into Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially looked into how hard it would be to convert Markdown into HTML with Nancy and as ever, very easy! I found some libraries that already provided the conversion process and decided upon &lt;a href="http://nuget.org/packages/MarkdownSharp/"&gt;MarkdownSharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then thought we could use Markdown as a proper view engine like Razor. I was unsure of how to provide the ability of model binding, master pages etc but after speaking to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/grumpydev"&gt;@grumpydev&lt;/a&gt; he suggested using the built in view engine with Nancy to provide that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you can have a Nancy route such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class SampleModule : NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = _ =&amp;gt;
        {
          var model = new UserModel{FirstName = "John", LastName = "Smith"};
          return View["Home", model];
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will find a Markdown file called Home.md or Home.markdown, translate the model and convert the markdown into a HTML view. You could define you markdown view like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Hi there!

My first name is @Model.FirstName and my last name is @Model.LastName
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would then translate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hi there!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first name is John and my last name is Smith&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple demonstration but what it means is that you can now use the Markdown view engine instead of Razor if you so wished. Things like model binding, master pages, partials, model iteration etc etc can all be handled by the view engine and your views can be written in Markdown. To use features like partials and master pages you use the Super Simple View Engine syntax that as it sounds is super simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wrote the Markdown view engine I also wrote a demo with the easy approach of Calepin in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a HTML view to act as my master page and then a route in Nancy that would take anything after the URL and find the view for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get["/{viewname}"] = parameters =&amp;gt;
{
    var popularposts = GetModel();

    dynamic postModel = new ExpandoObject();
    postModel.PopularPosts = popularposts;
    postModel.MetaData = popularposts.FirstOrDefault(x =&amp;gt; x.Slug == parameters.viewname);

    return View["Posts/" + parameters.viewname, postModel];
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Markdown file I would reference the master page, some partials, the model and a custom section for meta data about the blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Master['master']

@Tags
Date: 15/03/2013
Title: Readme
Tags: Nancy,Runtime
@EndTags

@Section['Content']

@Partial['blogheader', Model.MetaData];

# Readme!

## Markdown Viewengine

This Markdown Viewengine allows views to be written in Markdown.

* Full Model support
* Master page support
* Supports HTML within any MD content
* Simple call `return View["Home"]` for Nancy to render your MD file

## Markdown Blog Demo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would then render a good looking website with all the features expected in a view engine. It would use the meta data provided to write out things like page titles and tags for a blog post. It would also mean you could use the approach to write your own blog using Nancy and Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GetModel() method used above checks a “Posts” directory for Markdown files and reads the metadata for them. What this means is that you can easily write a blog post using Nancy, Markdown and SuperSimpleViewEngine by just uploading the markdown file to a specific directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would like to get rid of the master page and partial references so you could just have Markdown content in your file but I haven’t figured that out yet. Hopefully someone else can use the Markdown view engine or take the demo app and find an alternative way to provide the simplicity that Calepin offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it’s another nice feature that Nancy can offer its users and I have enjoyed contributing to the OSS project and tinkering with code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Markdown View Engine and Demo will be released in 0.17 of Nancy due very soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store your datetimes in UTC format into the database. Unfortunately this mean executing something like:
&lt;code&gt;myObject.ExpiryDate = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtc(dateTime, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(“timezoneid of users”)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every central place where you update/insert DateTime values on your objects you will need the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you display any DateTime information it must display as a local datetime value. You can do this by using     &lt;code&gt;myObject.ExpiryDate.ToLocalTime()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is if you stored a DateTime that was converted to UTC and it stored April 8th 14:30 2013, when a user in USA was given the date in their web application they would see it as April 8th 10:30 but UK users would read it as April 8th 15:30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an existing application you need to make sure the server side logic regarding date storage converts to UTC and that your view layer converts to local time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its risky but if your users are all on the same time zone and the database server and all operating systems are the same you don’t need to worry about this and can use DateTime.Now for everything.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that I could go back to my first language of Delphi or I could look into C++, Java or PHP but my counter argument might just be laughter. In my opinion these are old languages. They may be reliable for some needs but I feel its looking back to the past somewhat and not looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently come across &lt;a href="http://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; and want to spend some time looking into it to see if we suit each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dart is a class-based, object-oriented language with lexical scoping, closures, and optional static typing. Dart helps you build structured modern web apps and is easy to learn for a wide range of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org/"&gt;F#&lt;/a&gt; which I need to look at as my Twitter timeline has more and more references to this language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/"&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; but that’s as much as I know about it, the name. I think its based on Java and that rings alarm bells for me but I’m sure &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Cranialstrain"&gt;@Cranialstrain&lt;/a&gt; will put me right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://golang.org/"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and I’m sure there are many others that I could find but rightly or wrongly when deciding upon a language which lets be honest is a big investment you need to know there are the available jobs out there in that language. Its nice to learn new stuff and I highly recommend it but for me a whole new investment in a language has to warrant some pay offs such as employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for sure what language I’d use if I had to change, at present most likely JavaScript but probably that is based out of limited options on my part, maybe I need to become a better polyglot programmer and learn some more languages to have better “options” and not become irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what your primary language is and what you’d jump to if you had to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will list the various approaches I took investigating the how EF could be integrated. They are not in any chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approach One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach was to create a generic repository, IRepository, to handle the the various crud methods needed and also a Save method. The implementation, Repository would take a IUnitOfWork constructor dependency which would expose the model type ie.Customer,Order, Product and allow EF to perform the CRUD actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Repository : IRepository where T : class
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWork unitOfWork;
    private readonly DbSet entitySet;

    public Repository(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
    {
        this.unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
        entitySet = unitOfWork.GetEntitySet();
    }

    public void Add(T entity)
    {
        entitySet.Add(entity);        
    }
}

public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    void SaveChanges();
    DbSet GetEntitySet() where TEntity : class;
}

public OrderController(IRepository orderRepository, IRepository customerRepository )
{
    this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two issues with this approach. Firstly, the IUnitOfWork exposes EF specific members which I don’t really want and secondly when a repository calls Save it will in turn call the SaveChanges method on EF which will save any changes across all repositories. This is because we have one EF database context per request as handled by our IOC container. To get around the saving issue we could have a new context per instance of the repository but I don’t think that is a good approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code can be seen on the master branch at Github – &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/master/EntityFrameworkMVC"&gt;https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/master/EntityFrameworkMVC
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approach Two&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach we could use is to remove IUnitOfWork altogether, keep the Save method on the repository but inject the context into the repository and still inject the repositories into the controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Repository : IRepository where T : class
{
    private readonly EntityFrameworkMvcDbContext context;
    private readonly DbSet entitySet;

    public Repository(EntityFrameworkMvcDbContext context)
    {
        this.context = context;
        entitySet = context.Set();
    }

    public void Add(T entity)
    {
        entitySet.Add(entity);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is pretty close to what I think we would want and reasonably straight forward but I still don’t like the fact that the SaveChanges would effect every modified/added model across all repositories. If you’re happy to live with that then I think you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code can be seen on the LessAbstraction branch at Github – &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/LessAbstraction/EntityFrameworkMVC"&gt;https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/LessAbstraction/EntityFrameworkMVC
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approach Three&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach for using EF and building on from approach one was to remove the GetEntitySet from the IUnitOfWork interface but keep the Save method, inject the context into the repositories to allow them to add/update and inject the IUnitOfWork and repositories into the controllers so the repositories could use Add and then IUnitOfWork could be used to call SaveChanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    void SaveChanges();
}

public class Repository : IRepository where T : class
{
    private readonly DbSet entitySet;

    public Repository(EntityFrameworkMvcDbContext context)
    {
        entitySet = context.Set();
    }

    public void Add(T entity)
    {
        entitySet.Add(entity);  
    }
}

public OrderController(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork, IRepository orderRepository, IRepository customerRepository)
{
    this.unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
    this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a decent approach however, I think it could be tidied up so that the controllers don’t get cluttered with too many constructor dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code can be seen on the GenericContextPerRequest branch at Github – &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/GenericContextPerRequest/EntityFrameworkMVC"&gt;https://github.com/jchannon/EntityFrameworkMVC/tree/GenericContextPerRequest/EntityFrameworkMVC
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approach Four&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This below was another approach and the approach I decided I would use. It uses all the understandings gained from the above samples and hopes to provide a decent way of using EF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repositories are now exposed on the IUnitOfWork interface, the implementation takes the DBContext as a constructor dependency, the repository implementation also takes the DBContext to provide the CRUD features with EF and the controllers only have the IUnitOfWork injected into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    void SaveChanges();
    IRepository CustomerRepository { get; }
    IRepository ProductRepository { get; }
    IRepository OrderRepository { get; }
}

public OrderController(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork )
{
    this.unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we can keep our one database context per request, the controllers are tidied up so we no longer have numerous constructor dependencies and the repositories can be used to do CRUD and then SaveChanges can be called by IUnitOfWork when we have finished with the repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possible downside could be in time that we have numerous constructor dependencies on the IUnitOfWork implementation as well as numerous exposed repository properties on the IUnitOfWork interface. I don’t see this as a big issue as its only one class in your solution. If you didn’t want this to get too polluted you could create a repository factory and inject that into the controller and just have the SaveChanges on the IUnitOfWork interface. You wouldn’t want the IUnitOfWork to expose the repositories because as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daanleduc"&gt;@daanleduc&lt;/a&gt; pointed out to me that would violate the SRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only touched the basics of implementing EF into a MVC app but these approaches did take quite a while to discover and after hearing all the negativity towards EF and drawing from my experience I think I could see why people have issues with it in a much larger application as I’m sure there are other caveats to using EF. The biggest issue I saw with it was not exposing a Save method for the model type you were using, instead you have to commit all changes across the database context. I feel this made it quite difficult to create a decent architecture. I can see in a large enterprise application why EF could be helpful in allowing it to query the database for you and create/modify the tables for you based on your model changes but I think for now in smaller applications I think I still prefer micro-ORMs like PetaPoco, Dapper or Simple.Data due to the control it gives you and also the ease in which you can abstract the database communication. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cranialstrain"&gt;@Cranialstrain&lt;/a&gt; says “the database is an implementation detail”. I’d also like to thank all those on Jabbr that helped me with the above approaches and long discussions had about Entity Framework!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to get to the code then feel free to take a look here for &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/AngularShopping"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt; and here for &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/KnockoutShopping"&gt;Knockout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post will concentrate on AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Angular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the demos on the the home page and reading the docs I was ready to start. (I also got recommended &lt;a href="http://egghead.io/"&gt;egghead.io&lt;/a&gt; for lots of free AngularJS videos)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the look of Angular’s data bindings, it was very similar to &lt;a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/"&gt;HandlebarsJS&lt;/a&gt; which is a templating engine for JS and their specific attributes for doing certain things in the DOM seemed clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello {{yourName}}!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular uses “Controllers” and coming from experience with MVC it turned out they’re not really controllers but more ViewModels. Each Controller handles its own specific task for example, in CRUD you’d probably have a controller for each create, read, update and delete. I believe its possible to make it have one controller but that’s a bit more advanced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in the SammyJS demo comes via a data.json file so I duly created my file and followed the examples of wiring up a backend. This is when things start getting a bit more in depth with Angular opposed to a simple Hello World app. Angular provides its own internal IOC container which is recommended you use to keep things nicely separated and of course it then injects your controller’s dependencies for you. See &lt;a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more about the subject. There is a bit of configuration needed in various places and one missing item or spelling mistake and you’ll be stuck due to the nature of dynamic nature of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to get my wirings all sorted and my products displayed on screen but when I wanted to retrieve a single item this is when I started scratching my head. The recommended way of doing it was to use an abstracted class called $resource which allows you to query REST based services and obviously with just having one file this wasn’t going to work. $resource sits on top of $http but after playing with that I discarded my file and stuck it in memory for ease. If you’d like to see a $http demo with Nancy as a REST service see &lt;a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/WebDev/UIDevelopment/Javascript/angularjs"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&amp;amp;author=7"&gt;Christiaan Baes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now with a bit of filtering I could find my product and display it on screen. I had a controller for listing my products and another controller for displaying one item and a dependency injected into both to allow me to retrieve the data I wanted to display and I also had my routing setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Routing
var app = angular.module('myCart', []).
        config(function ($routeProvider) {
            $routeProvider.
                when('/', {
                    controller: 'IndexController',
                    templateUrl: '/templates/list.html'
                }).
                when('/:id', {
                    controller: 'DetailController',
                    templateUrl: '/templates/detail.html'
                }).
                otherwise({ redirectTo: '/' });
        });

//Repository
app.factory('shoppingItemsService', function () {
        var data = [
            //My data is here!
        ];

        return {
            getItems: function () { return data; },
            getItem: function (itemId) {
                return data.filter(function (x) { return x.id === parseInt(itemId, 10); })[0];
            }
        };
    });

//List Controller
app.controller(
        'IndexController',
        function ($scope, shoppingItemsService) {
            $scope.items = shoppingItemsService.getItems();
        }
    );

//Detail Controller
app.controller(
        'DetailController',
        function ($scope, $routeParams, basketService, shoppingItemsService) {

            $scope.item = shoppingItemsService.getItem($routeParams.id);
            $scope.item.quantity = 1;

            $scope.item.basketCount = basketService.getCount();

            $scope.addItem = function () {
                basketService.addItem($scope.item);
            };
        }
    );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the app is based around a single page application (SPA) the main area on the screen would show the products or product selected however I had an area, the cart info, that showed the quantity of items in my basket outside this main area. After a lot of head scratching I realised I could create a new controller that was responsible for setting a viewmodel property of the quantity and only update that specific area on screen. This meant when I was viewing a product and added a certain quantity to the basket this area would update automatically. Finally in the demo for a bit of added pizazz the cart info area animates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one bit that took me a long time to get my head around. Angular recommends that no DOM manipulation occurs in controllers but in separate classes/functions called Directives. I understand why, to keep your viewmodel not dependent on your view but man it was hard work! Directives allow you to determine your own HTML elements that Angular understands, again you can pass in dependencies and they will get resolved for you. Put whatever logic you want in your directive and then manipulate the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.directive('quantity', function () {
        var linker = function (scope, element, attrs, basketService) {

            scope.$watch(attrs.quantity, function (value, oldValue) {
                if (value &amp;gt; oldValue) {
                    element
                    .animate({ paddingTop: '30px' })
                    .animate({ paddingTop: '10px' });
                }
            }, true);
        };

        return {
            restrict: 'A',
            link: linker
        };
    });

//Usage
&amp;lt;div class="cart-info" ng-controller="CartController" quantity="basketCount()"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things I found with Angular was that it was quite fiddly to setup however the documentation was very good and I had help from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/philjones88"&gt;Phil Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Once I had solved whatever issue I was having at the time it was glaringly obvious what was needed and I why I was having problems but that’s all part of the learning curve I guess but mighty frustrating. Angular is certainly all encompassing by handling routing, model binding, separation of concerns and much more and so for a large app I can certainly see its potential but for small apps it may be a bit over the top but overall I did like it. There are also library extensions such as &lt;a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/"&gt;AngularUI&lt;/a&gt; which provide custom directives for DOM manipulation, ranked &lt;a href="http://ngmodules.org/"&gt;popular modules&lt;/a&gt; and specific &lt;a href="https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang"&gt;Angular debuggers&lt;/a&gt; so this framework certainly has a lot behind it and I definitely think it will be sticking around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Knockout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly Knockout should be commended on their documentation and online tutorials. Their website tutorials follows a step by step approach and once you have completed each step you can click through to the next section.

There is great support in the KnockoutJS room in Jabbr and I’d like to thank &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davepermen"&gt;David Spörri&lt;/a&gt; for answering my newbie JS and Knockout questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knockout also uses HTML elements and attributes like Angular to determine behaviour but Knockout’s approach is more HTML5 in that the most common usage is using the data-bind attribute. For example, the below will use the artist property on the viewmodel to render the div contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div data-bind="text: artist"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this was going to be a SPA (Single Page Application), the main screen would have an area that would display either a list of products or more information about a single product. The way Knockout handles this is via a ‘with’ keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="main"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Main Page --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div data-bind="with: items"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Detail Page --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div data-bind="with: chosenProduct"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the viewmodel’s ‘items’ property is populated it would show the first div and when the ‘chosenProduct’ property was populated it would show the second div. Nice and simple. You can then populate your markup with properties from the items and chosenProduct within those div’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have 2 pages/sections in our app we need to handle routing so that when we’re going to the root it populates our view model with all our products and when the user clicks a specific product it finds that product and populates our view model. KnockoutJS does not have this built into it like Angular does and uses SammyJS to handle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var app = Sammy(function () {
    this.get('#/:id', function (context) {
        self.items(null);
        var product = data.filter(function (x) {
            return x.id === parseInt(context.params.id, 10);
        })[0];
        product.quantity = 1;
        self.chosenProduct(product);
    });

    this.get('/', function () {
        self.items(data);
        self.chosenProduct(null);
    });
});

jQuery(function () {
    console.log('rn');
    app.run();
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Angular’s separation approach, here we have most things all in one class/viewmodel i.e/ the routing to assign the items property for all products and single item for the selected product as well as other viewmodel properties. We also have functions to add items and determine quantity as well as saving the information to &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage"&gt;localStorage&lt;/a&gt;. I guess it keeps it altogether in one place but this may get tricky once the app becomes quite large however, I’ve been told things can get separated by using &lt;a href="http://requirejs.org/"&gt;RequireJS&lt;/a&gt; although I think in this demo that would require a large refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again in this demo outside of the main area that gets changed with markup we have a shopping cart that needs to update when we add something. I already had a function that calculated my quantities but it did not update the div with the new value. Even though the viewmodel property was a computed function it was not re-run every time something was added to the basket, for that to happen the computed function needs to have an observable property within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.basketItemCount = ko.computed(function () {
       var count = 0;
       var items = self.basketItems();
       for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; items.length; i%2B%2B) {
           count %2B= items[i].quantity(); //Given that the quantity is an observable property
       }
       return count;
   });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to do some animation when the item was added to the basket and because SammyJS has a dependency on jQuery it was very easy to add this to the viewmodel’s addItem function however like Angular this is not recommended as it ties the view to the viewmodel. What Knockout recommend is custom bindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ko.bindingHandlers.animateCart = {
    update: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor) {
        $(element)
            .animate({ paddingTop: '30px' })
            .animate({ paddingTop: '10px' });
    }
};

//Usage
&amp;lt;div class="cart-info" data-bind="animateCart: basketAsJson()"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is where the data binding gets confusing/interesting. My HTML could not use the basketItems viewmodel property as this is an observable array and so would only react when the array changed NOT when properties of objects within the array changed. I was a bit disappointed with that so I had to create a new function that obviously used an observeable within it ie/the basketItems but that was not enough to handle the properties changing within that array. So the recommendation from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robwesterlund"&gt;Robert Westerlund&lt;/a&gt; (a Javascript, Knockout and Regex wizard) was to use ko.toJSON(basketItems()). (The reason we use ko.toJSON and not JSON.stringify is because that would not pick up the observeable property values) This would mean that it would have to traverse all the objects to find the values and because they are observeable this function would fire every time, genius! This also meant when it changed I could also store the changes in localStorage for when the user came back to the website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Knockout easier to comprehend and get going with compared to Angular which is always a winner when starting something new but Knockout is pretty much just about binding so for things like routing and separation of concerns you need to use other libraries whereas Angular has all that built in. I think for smaller projects without too much logic required Knockout is ideal and I really like the simplicity of SammyJS however, for larger applications that requires dependency injection, a clear separation of concerns and the easy ability to unit test logic Angular is a winner. In this case the term “pick the right tool for the job” certainly applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should go ahead and investigate Backbone now just to fully educate myself and I’ve been recommend this link – &lt;a href="https://github.com/kjbekkelund/writings/blob/master/published/understanding-backbone.md"&gt;“Step by step from jQuery to Backbone”&lt;/a&gt; so here goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After following a few “Hello World” tutorials from Microsoft I thought I’d take a look at the ToDo list demos shown at &lt;a href="http://TodoMVC.com"&gt;TodoMVC.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website/Github repository takes the ToDo demo and implements it in all the various JS frameworks and libraries out there. As I said previously its a minefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I thought I’d start with Backbone, copy the files, add the references to WinJS and hit F5 and bingo. However, I got the below error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/DOQl1.png" alt="Unhandled Exception" title="Unhandled Exception" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit confused, I googled the issue and found that Microsoft have implemented security principles in WinJS applications to prevent un-sanitized markup to your page. So any time you might dynamically add some HTML to your page your application will throw an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this issue you can wrap your dynamic content calls with &lt;em&gt;execUnsafeLocalFunction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about that from Microsoft’s documentation &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/apps/hh767331.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how you would execute the function around dynamically adding HTML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MSApp.execUnsafeLocalFunction(function() {
  var body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
  body.innerHTML = 'example';
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved onto Angular to see if that would help but again I hit the same bug. I did find in the Angular code that if you have a reference to jQuery in your page it would use that, so I downloaded the latest version, referenced it and still the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t realise is that Backbone and Angular both ship jQuery or a subset of it within them and I didn’t fancy modifying those libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/appendto/jquery-win8"&gt;jquery-win8&lt;/a&gt; from appendTo which I thought was the answer so referenced that and still the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then gave KnockoutJS a go and it worked perfectly, the reason being no dependency on jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a question on StackOverflow and after a couple of days &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elijahmanor"&gt;Elijah Manor&lt;/a&gt; of AppendTo answered me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;appendTo’s version removes errors that occur when running jQuery at load time. You still may have code that violates the security model Microsoft put in place. Microsoft is trying to make you aware that there is a risk adding un-sanitized markup to your page.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;If you are confident that is not the case you can try setting jQuery.isUnsafe to true after the appendTo library is included. That should wrap all possible unsafe calls with MSApp.execUnsafeLocalFunction so that Microsoft doesn’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Note: This flag is turned off by default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I setup the Angular version of the TodoMVC demo in my Win8 application, referenced the WinJS libs, jquery-win8 and set &lt;code&gt;jQuery.isUnsafe&lt;/code&gt; to true and the app started perfectly and all functionality was present. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src="//Microsoft.WinJS.1.0/js/base.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="/js/default.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="js/jquery-1.8.2-win8-1.0.min.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;
    jQuery.isUnsafe = true;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that jquery-win8 runs off of jQuery 1.8.2 but appendTo are working on a 1.9 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript can now promote one language to develop on the server and the client which makes things easier and that is one argument I understand and I’m sure there are many others which either I have forgotten or I’m unaware of but the truth is JavaScript seems to be picking up pace in the development world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have things like &lt;a href="http://coffeescript.org/"&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; that abstracts JS and allows users to type arguably neater code which then compiles into JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news is that Microsoft have developed &lt;a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/"&gt;Typescript&lt;/a&gt; which is an attempt to coerce or make the transition easier for C# developers to use JavaScript. Their mantra for TypeScript is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this development along with the fact that Windows 8 applications can be written in C#/XAML &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; JavaScript/HTML proves that MS and therefore probably the mainstream of developers are taking JS as a serious platform to start writing large production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am off to a &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetdevnet.com/Meetings/tabid/54/EntryID/73/Default.aspx"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about TypeScript with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle"&gt;@markrendle&lt;/a&gt; on Jan 22nd so it’ll be interesting to see the language and the points put forward about it and JS as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier there is a large focus on rich content applications which use JS to make the application quick and easy to use and frameworks like KnockoutJS, AngularJS and Backbone have popped up allowing you to create these types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest concern is which one do you use? I’ve had recommendations for each one which hasn’t helped. KnockoutJS is developed by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/stevensanderson"&gt;@stevensanderson&lt;/a&gt; who works for MS so you could say it might be best to use that as it maybe more main stream and a more common requirement for employers to see you know it. I’ve heard arguments that AngularJS &amp;amp; BackBone provide the ability to write a more larger scale JS application where Knockout only provides JS type data binding and validation so again this is beneficial. I also discussed with someone that they and their company evaluated all of them and decided that the learning curve was too high for each and they went with jQuery and various plugins and &lt;a href="http://mustache.github.com/"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt; for binding scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are arguments that you should use a library/framework that supplies the solution to your requirements but generally developers want to learn something that will have long lasting benefits to them, yes they learn things for the sake of it but mostly it will benefit them in the long run, for example, you don’t hear of much use for the &lt;a href="http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/"&gt;Whitespace&lt;/a&gt; programming language do you? So whilst there is an obvious push for more intensive use of JavaScript there still seems to be some sort of barrier to entry in deciding upon the correct path to take. Maybe over time the strongest will survive but whilst you’re waiting 1-2 years for something to mature you’re possibly losing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Nancy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy is a lightweight framework for building websites / services without getting in your way. It’s heavily inspired by a Ruby project called Sinatra, which happens to identify itself as not being a framework, since it doesn’t include all the plumbing of things such as an ORM, lots of configuration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does it implement MVC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy does not force you to adhere to the model-view-controller pattern, or any other pattern. It’s nothing more than a service endpoint responding to HTTP verbs. Making it ideal for building Websites, Web Services and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Nancy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy is a lightweight framework for building websites / services without getting in your way. It’s heavily inspired by a Ruby project called Sinatra, which happens to identify itself as not being a framework, since it doesn’t include all the plumbing of things such as an ORM, lots of configuration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does it implement MVC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy does not force you to adhere to the model-view-controller pattern, or any other pattern. It’s nothing more than a service endpoint responding to HTTP verbs. Making it ideal for building Websites, Web Services and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t apply the MVC pattern to Nancy. You can define Views and put them in a Views folder, create Models to return from your endpoints, and map requests to Models, just like you currently do with ASP.NET MVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Key Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier Testing&lt;/strong&gt; – Nancy provides a testing library that allows you to test the full request/response cycle so not only can you test that your request returns the model you expect you can test that when you pass in accept headers the response is in the format you expect. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Fact]
public void GetData_WhenRequested_ShouldReturnOKStatusCode()
{
    var browser = new Browser();
    var response = browser.Get("/GetData", (with) =&amp;gt;
    {
        with.Header("Authorization", "Bearer johnsmith");
        with.Header("Accept", "application/json");
        with.HttpRequest();
    });

    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Forbidden, response.StatusCode);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unaware of how you would be able to test this in MVC without it being a full integration test whereas Nancy has no dependencies on System.Web or MVC so it can provide us with a Response without hitting a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Dependency Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; – Nancy provides an in built IOC container called &lt;a href="https://github.com/grumpydev/TinyIoC"&gt;TinyIOC&lt;/a&gt; which will find all your dependencies automatically for you or if you want/need to configure something you can do so at various points in your application. This is done in a Bootstrapper class that exposes various methods and properties to allow you to configure Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void ConfigureApplicationContainer(TinyIoCContainer container)
{
    base.ConfigureApplicationContainer(container);

    var store = new EmbeddableDocumentStore()
    {
        ConnectionStringName = "RavenDB"
    };

    store.Initialize();

    container.Register(store);
}

protected override void ConfigureRequestContainer(TinyIoCContainer container, NancyContext context)
{
    base.ConfigureRequestContainer(container, context);

    var store = container.Resolve();
    var documentSession = store.OpenSession();

    container.Register(documentSession);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the IOC container is used in different places within an application’s lifecycle. Once at the startup and once per request. It registers a DocumentStore which should be done only once in an application and then on every request it finds the DocumentStore and uses it to open a session and registers it with the IOC. If you have a service that has a IDocumentSession dependency then it will come via this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you’re being stubborn and want to use your preferred IOC container, Nancy supports all the main IOC players allowing you to register your dependencies with them instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completely Customisable, Conventions &amp;amp; Better Extension Points&lt;/strong&gt; – One of Nancy’s core features is its extensibility. It it designed to allow you to replace any part you want. You can have custom model binders, view renderers, serializers in fact you can implement your own INancyEngine and completely change how Nancy handles requests etc. There are also a set of pre-defined conventions that you can swap in/out if you want Nancy to do something different than what comes as standard. Everything is complete customisable and very easy to modify Nancy’s behaviour which offers great extensibility points if you wanted to create a 3rd party library for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terse Syntax &amp;amp; Less Ceremony&lt;/strong&gt; – Nancy provides a nice terse syntax that does not get in the way of your application and leaves you to write your code. What I have found is that due to the terse syntax it encourages you to make your application code nice and neat too. One example of less ceremony and terseness is that you can get a full Nancy application running inside a 140 character tweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HelloModule : NancyModule
{
    public HelloModule()
    {
        Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; "Hello World";
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runs on Mono&lt;/strong&gt; – Nancy does not tie itself down to Windows it works just as well on OSX and Linux under &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page"&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt; which allows your team to work on multiple platforms. In fact Nancy can even run on a &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; I would like to see ASP.NET MVC do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Negotiation&lt;/strong&gt; – Content Negotiation is built into Nancy and runs out of the box. This means Nancy can be used in an API type application as well as a website application. In fact if you wanted you could have it do both very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; {
    return Negotiate
    .WithModel(new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy "})
    .WithMediaRangeModel("text/html", new RatPack {FirstName = "Nancy fancy pants"})
    .WithView("negotiatedview")
    .WithHeader("X-Custom", "SomeValue");
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demo highlights that if you made a request to “/” in your application by a web browser it will return a specific model with a property name of “Nancy fancy pants”, return a view called “negotiatedview” and return a custom header. However, if your API client made a request to “/” it would return a model with “Nancy” and a custom header. The resulting model would then be serialized into JSON, JSONP, XML or any other variation specified in the Accept header from your client. This example is possibly contrived somewhat but Nancy supplies conneg from all routes so something like the below would be serialized based on the headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; {
    var model = MyModel();
    return model;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Config&lt;/strong&gt; – To get Nancy up and running there is no config required, no nasty XML files to modify, nothing. As its host agnostic you don’t have to modify anything in web.config to have it running via IIS for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runs Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; – As I just mentioned Nancy is host agnostic which means you can run it in IIS, WCF, embedded within a EXE, as a windows service or within a self hosted application. Pretty much everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipeline Hooks&lt;/strong&gt; – Nancy allows you to modify the pipeline ie.the request and response before and after they are invoked. One simple example is saving your data at the end of a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;protected override void RequestStartup(TinyIoCContainer container, IPipelines pipelines, NancyContext context)
{
    base.RequestStartup(container, pipelines, context);

    pipelines.AfterRequest.AddItemToEndOfPipeline((ctx) =&amp;gt;
    {
        var documentSession = container.Resolve();

        if (ctx.Response.StatusCode != HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError)
        {
            documentSession.SaveChanges();
        }

        documentSession.Dispose();
    });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we configure the AfterRequest delegate to find the IDocumentSession used in the request, save the changes to the database and then dispose of the IDocumentSession (although TinyIOC would actually dispose of this for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more complex example could be that you modify the way the Request.Form is populated on a HTTP POST, it is that extensible and configurable you could do that quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ties to System.Web and a Freely Designed Framework&lt;/strong&gt; – System.Web is the core DLL based in ASP.Net. It contains the whole kitchen sink of the framework so you get everything bundled into your application even if you only use 25% of the possibilities. Nancy is architected the other way in that there are &lt;a href="http://nuget.org/packages?q=nancy"&gt;numerous plugins&lt;/a&gt; that supply additional and alternative functionality. Nancy is also not bound to any specific implementation or framework and all requests and responses are built from the ground up allowing it to be loosely coupled and free. This also means that Nancy can run in the .Net client profile environments without the added requirement for .Net full profile that ASP.NET MVC does require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support &amp;amp; Community&lt;/strong&gt; – One of the great things about Nancy is its community and support. They have a very active &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/nancy-web-framework"&gt;Google group&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll find loads of help in &lt;a href="http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/nancyfx"&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt; to get your questions answered ASAP. There is a real feeling of community and support because people want to spread the good word about Nancy. It has over 100 contributors to the project but keep in mind the vision, impetus and most of the work is done by 2 guys, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GrumpyDev"&gt;@GrumpyDev&lt;/a&gt; not a huge team sitting in Redmond. One final thing the &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.spreadshirt.net/"&gt;swag &lt;/a&gt;is a lot more stylish than Microsoft t-shirts :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my last &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/11/29/asp-net-web-api-testing/" title="ASP.NET Web API Testing"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; I described how you could test the full pipeline in ASP.NET Web API because Microsoft don’t supply a nice way to do it. This blog post got the attention of Microsoft and at the time of writing this blog post it has had over 3150 hits and appeared on the home page of ASP.NET. The core of the code in that post was taken out of Nancy. So please if you liked what you saw there, give Nancy a try I think you’ll find there many benefits described above as well as others I’ve not mentioned. It is your duty as software developers to try new things and investigate tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when your next project comes about and your manager says “Ok lets write our new app in ASP.NET MVC” your reactions should be reflected by these animated GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we really use ASP.NET MVC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.minus.com/imM6lHNgto38I.gif" alt="Should we use ASP.NET MVC?" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The boss says we can use Nancy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.minus.com/i3nPmdfBC2VaH.gif" alt="All systems go" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have our new Nancy app up and running in no time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.minus.com/ie4Om0y5NXhS1.gif" alt="Up and Running" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you build your project a *.nupkg is created ready for publishing with NuGet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you have no AssemblyInfo.cs or *.nuspec file then that package won’t contain anything that useful about your package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the easiest thing to do is amend your AssemblyInfo.cs file &lt;a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#From_a_project"&gt;with information about your package&lt;/a&gt; if you have an AssemblyInfo.cs file. If you don’t have one its not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build your project, open the *.nupkg file that was created with &lt;a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/using-a-gui-to-build-packages"&gt;Nuget Package Explorer&lt;/a&gt; and edit the metadata adding any extra information you want about your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If your solution has NuGet restore turned on the build will pick up the dependencies required for your project. Cool eh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click File – Save Metadata As, and save the *.nuspec file into the same place as your *.csproj file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Visual Studio and include this *.nuspec file in your project. Open it and remove the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;files&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/files&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; node unless you are including other specific files with your package. I found it created a node that pointed to /lib/net45/myProject.dll which was unnecessary and resulted in my project not compiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future you can edit this *.nuspec file for example when you have a new version and when you build your project it will create a nice new *.nupkg file based on the information provided in the *.nuspec file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to &lt;a href="http://nuget.org/"&gt;nuget.org&lt;/a&gt; and register/logon and upload your *.nupkg file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say all performed as expected and I was actually surprised to find that implementing ASP.NET Web API was easier than ServiceStack (I know that might be a bit of a statement to make to the ServiceStack followers, sorry).

&lt;p&gt;When it came to testing ASP.NET Web API I found it to be wanting slightly in comparison to Nancy.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that you could configure a lot of stuff to get a HttpResponseMessage back as shown below however in my opinion it wasn’t particularly easy on the eye and seemed a bit over the top just to get a response back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Arrange
var config = new HttpConfiguration();
var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, "http://localhost/api/products");
var route = config.Routes.MapHttpRoute("DefaultApi", "api/{controller}/{id}");
var routeData = new HttpRouteData(route, new HttpRouteValueDictionary { { "controller", "products" } });
var controller = new ProductsController(repo);
controller.ControllerContext = new HttpControllerContext(config, routeData, request);
controller.Request = request;
controller.Request.Properties[HttpPropertyKeys.HttpConfigurationKey] = config;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can call your controller method and assert against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Act
var result = controller.PostProduct(new Product { Id = 1 });

// Assert
Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Created, result.StatusCode);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t take credit for finding this out though. I found it on &lt;a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/06/16/unit-testing-asp-dot-net-web-api/"&gt;Peter Provost&lt;/a&gt; blog post where he says &lt;a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/"&gt;Brad Wilson&lt;/a&gt; helped him construct the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t positive whether the HTTP response returned was as pure as if the request was actually made to a server. By understanding the &lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/tree/master/src/Nancy.Testing"&gt;Nancy.Testing&lt;/a&gt; library I knew that the response given there was an exact copy of what would be given if hitting a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then investigated a bit more and found a great blog post by &lt;a href="http://www.strathweb.com/2012/06/asp-net-web-api-integration-testing-with-in-memory-hosting/"&gt;Filip W&lt;/a&gt; about in-memory hosting. This essentially mirrors a server in terms of receiving a request and issuing a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I knew from Nancy I thought I could apply it to Web API. What this meant was you could submit requests and test against the response. I’m not sure how you would classify it in terms of unit testing or integration testing because the tests run very quickly but I suppose you are hitting an actual server albeit in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a simple test looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class GetDataTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void GetData_WhenRequested_ShouldReturnJSON()
    {
        var browser = new Browser();
        var response = browser.Get("/GetData", (with) =&amp;gt;
        {
            with.Header("Accept", "application/json");
            with.HttpRequest();
        });

        Assert.Equal("application/json", response.Content.Headers.ContentType.MediaType);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetData_WhenRequested_ShouldReturnOKStatusCode()
    {
        var browser = new Browser();
        var response = browser.Get("/GetData", (with) =&amp;gt;
        {
            with.Header("Authorization", "Bearer johnsmith");
            with.Header("Accept", "application/json");
            with.HttpRequest();
        });

        Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Forbidden, response.StatusCode);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define your test, in this case &lt;a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/"&gt;xUnit&lt;/a&gt;. You create an instance of the Browser class. This is just a class name there is no browser, it doesn’t fire up IE or anything like that. You then call a method named after a HTTP verb with a path specified. You also have the ability to specify items within the request such as headers, form values and cookies using a delegate. The methods in the Browser class will return a HttpResponseMessage which is what Web API server returns and you can then assert against the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delving a little deeper into the code, the Browser class takes an optional HttpConfiguration constructor argument or if one is not supplied it uses the below configuration. It then creates an instance of HttpServer and passes the configuration into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private readonly HttpServer _server;

public Browser()
{
    var config = new HttpConfiguration();
    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(name: "Default", routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{action}/{id}", defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional });
    config.IncludeErrorDetailPolicy = IncludeErrorDetailPolicy.Always;
    _server = new HttpServer(config);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a method is called it then builds up a HttpRequestMessage using the items defined in the delegate in the unit test and passes it to the server variable and the HttpResponseMessage is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public HttpResponseMessage Get(string path, Action browserContext = null)
{
  return this.HandleRequest(HttpMethod.Get, path, browserContext);
}

private HttpResponseMessage HandleRequest(HttpMethod method, string path, Action browserContext)
{
    var request = CreateRequest(method, path, browserContext ?? this.DefaultBrowserContext);

    if (BrowserHttpClient == null)
        BrowserHttpClient = new HttpClient(_server);

    HttpResponseMessage response = BrowserHttpClient.SendAsync(request).Result;

    request.Dispose();

    if (_server != null)
    {
        _server.Dispose();
    }

    return response;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives you the ability to pretty much test the full pipeline of a request and response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Github repository is located &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/WebAPI.Testing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and if you like what you see please take a closer look into &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only ever used it in the traditional sense of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++)
{

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into some more and thought I’d show anybody else who may not have known about this innocent little thing in the C# language. It may exist in other languages but I am explicitly talking about C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (; ; )
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason this compiles and executes! Who knew? Smarter people than me obviously. What do you expect it to output?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is it outputs “Hi” forever as there is nothing to determine when the loop should end however there is nothing to determine when it should start either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is it outputs “Hi” forever as there is nothing to determine when the loop should end however there is nothing to determine when it should start either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to investigate what other weird syntax the for loop would take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 3; ; )
{
  Console.WriteLine("Number " + i);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Number 3″ forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; ; )
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Hi” forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; ; Console.WriteLine("Hi"))
{

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Hi” forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (; ; RunThis())
{

}

private void RunThis()
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Hi” forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; ; Console.WriteLine("Hi"))
{
  Console.WriteLine(" there");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Hi there” forever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (string s = "Hi"; ; )
{
  Console.WriteLine(s);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will output “Hi” forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think the below will do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (Initialize(); ; )
{

}

private void Initialize()
{
  Console.WriteLine("Initialized");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually outputs “Initliazed” and sits in an infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below probably does what you expect it to by looping 0-9 and exits yet still something I’d never considered doing in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = InitializeInt(); i &amp;lt; 10; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}

private static int InitializeInt()
{
  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a slight deviation on the above but essentially the same just with a Func&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Func factory = () =&amp;gt; 0;

for (int i = factory(); i &amp;lt; 10; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the below is possible and something I’d never do but still possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (var val = Init(); val.MyInt &amp;lt; 10; val.MyInt++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(val.MyString);
}

public struct MyStruct
{
  public int MyInt { get; set; }
  public string MyString { get; set; }
}

private MyStruct Init()
{
  return new MyStruct() { MyInt = 0, MyString = "Hi" };
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think the below will do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool ok = true;
for (; ok; )
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi");
  ok = false;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will enter the loop once and then exit. It acts as a normal loop just without the initialization of an int i and increasing the value of i on each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be some other syntaxes it will accept but I’ve not found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence the for loop has no expectations, it will execute with no arguments specified infinitely. In each 3 places of a for loop you can do pretty much what you want, I did find you couldn’t initialize an int and a string like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (string s="Hi", int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10;i++ )
{

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its only really the middle section that determines when the loop should end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never thought of using the for loop in these ways but it seems its possible for some reason. I’m starting to wonder if I’m not a good programmer for not knowing this or whether its just one of those things that’s odd but available in the language and if places like Google ask you in interview “What does this do? Does it compile?” to try and almost trick you for some reason. I’m sure there would be some problem solving argument for asking but I’m not sure what that proves as if you were a good developer you would never use it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New project scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re all very excited about your new project and you think its about time you committed this to source control. Obviously you’re using &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; so you initialise a new repository and commit your files. You then setup a remote repository at &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and it asks you whether you want it create a .gitignore file – you do. So now you have a repository remotely and locally. Easiest thing to do is pull from the remote, setup your remote and push to it. The other scenario might be you’ve committed locally and then realise you need to add a .gitignore file which you do and then commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New project scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re all very excited about your new project and you think its about time you committed this to source control. Obviously you’re using &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; so you initialise a new repository and commit your files. You then setup a remote repository at &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and it asks you whether you want it create a .gitignore file – you do. So now you have a repository remotely and locally. Easiest thing to do is pull from the remote, setup your remote and push to it. The other scenario might be you’ve committed locally and then realise you need to add a .gitignore file which you do and then commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases you will now see the files in your &lt;a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore"&gt;standardised .gitignore file&lt;/a&gt; are not being ignored. After a few head scratches you realise its because the .gitignore file should be added to your repo first before any commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The solution!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short you have to remove all tracked files and add them back in using the below commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line unstages and removes the paths to your files from the git index recursively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second line adds all your files back in but because the .gitignore is present it will not add files that should be ignored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final line commits all your files back to the index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I’d like to take credit for this knowledge I’m going to have to point you in the direction of the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139762/gitignore-file-not-ignoring"&gt;stackoverflow post&lt;/a&gt; that has helped me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

One of those improvements was to Git publishing so when you pushed changes to your Github repository Azure would automatically pick that up and deploy the project. I even mentioned it in my &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/" title="NancyFX, RavenDB, NerdDinner and Me"&gt;DinnerParty blog post&lt;/a&gt; but have only just looked at implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in my previous post Azure supported Git publishing but it was a two step process. You push to Github and then push to Azure and it gets deployed. If you already have Git setup on your Azure account there is nowhere in the dashboard that allows to you setup Github integration. I thought I was going to have reset my deployment credentials and set it all up again when I asked the question on &lt;a href="http://jabbr.net"&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/davidfowl"&gt;David Fowler&lt;/a&gt; was online. Why is that lucky? He wrote the Github integration feature of Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup your Azure account to enable Github integration you have to FTP into your Azure account and delete the deployment history by deleting all contents in the /site/deployments folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployment History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/deploymenthistory-620x604.png" alt="Deployment History" title="Deployment History" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployment History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the history is deleted, if you go to the Deployments tab in the Azure account you will now see a link to “Deploy from my GitHub repository”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/afterdeploymentdelete-620x527.png" alt="Setup" title="Setup " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By clicking the link it will inform you that you need to authorize Azure to have access to your Github repository and that if there is code already in your repository it will be deployed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/setup-620x320.png" alt="Authorize" title="Authorize" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authorize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you authorize Azure to read your Github account you need to tell it which repository it should watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/authorize.png" alt="Repository" title="Repository" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repository&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, if there is code in the repo it will begin to deploy automatically and confirm deployment once this has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/deploying-initial-620x197.png" alt="Deploying" title="Deploying" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deploying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/deployed-620x202.png" alt="Deployed" title="Deployed" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, once you push changes to your Github repository Azure will pick them up and deploy the project to your web site! Could it get any easier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 7th Nov 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; After speaking to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/davidfowl"&gt;David Fowler&lt;/a&gt; again he remembered that you could take the Git webservice hook and enter that into the Github repository account settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Configure tab in Azure and copy the Git hoook URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/azurehook-620x135.png" alt="Azure Hook" title="Azure Hook" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azure Hook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to your Github repo and into the Admin section and under Service Hooks enter the copied Azure URL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/github-hook-620x260.png" alt="Github Hook" title="Github Hook" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Github Hook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away you go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process was reasonably easy but not as simple as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.Net Simple Social Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was made aware of an OSS project by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/philliphaydon"&gt;@philliphaydon&lt;/a&gt; whilst keeping up to speed with the latest &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX &lt;/a&gt;goings on in &lt;a href="http://jabbr.net"&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt; that aims to provide a simple way of using social networks to log into a site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out aimed at ASP.Net MVC but after a bit of arm bending from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/philliphaydon"&gt;@philliphaydon&lt;/a&gt; it was refactored to be web framework agnostic so it could be used with &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being enthusiastic, I asked if any help was needed and I ended up making a simple demo website using &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me see some code I hear you say so here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootstrapper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Bootstrapper : DefaultNancyBootstrapper
{
    private const string TwitterConsumerKey = "Rb7qNNPUPsRSYkznFTbF6Q";
    private const string TwitterConsumerSecret = "pP1jBdYOlmCzo08QFJjGIHY4YSyPdGLPO2m1q47hu9c";
    private const string FacebookAppId = "159181340893340";
    private const string FacebookAppSecret = "97c4e4d0fa548232cf8f9c68a7adcff9";
    private const string GoogleConsumerKey = "587140099194.apps.googleusercontent.com";
    private const string GoogleConsumerSecret = "npk1_gx-gqJmLiJRPFooxCEY";

   protected override void ApplicationStartup(TinyIoCContainer container, IPipelines pipelines)
   {
       RegisterAuthenticationProviders(container);

       base.ApplicationStartup(container, pipelines);

       CookieBasedSessions.Enable(pipelines);
   }

   private static void RegisterAuthenticationProviders(TinyIoCContainer container)
   {
       Condition.Requires(container).IsNotNull();

       var twitterProvider = new TwitterProvider(TwitterConsumerKey, TwitterConsumerSecret,
                                                 new Uri(
                                                     "http://localhost:6969/AuthenticateCallback?providerKey=Twitter"));

       var facebookProvider = new FacebookProvider(FacebookAppId, FacebookAppSecret,
                                                   new Uri(
                                                       "http://localhost:6969/AuthenticateCallback?providerKey=facebook"));

       var googleProvider = new GoogleProvider(GoogleConsumerKey, GoogleConsumerSecret,
                                               new Uri(
                                                   "http://localhost:6969/AuthenticateCallback?providerKey=google"));

       var authenticationService = new AuthenticationService();
       authenticationService.AddProvider(twitterProvider);
       authenticationService.AddProvider(facebookProvider);
       authenticationService.AddProvider(googleProvider);

       container.Register(authenticationService);
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HomeModule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HomeModule : NancyModule
{  
   private const string SessionGuidKey = "GUIDKey";

   public HomeModule(IAuthenticationService authenticationService)
   {
       Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; View["login"];

       Get["/RedirectToAuthenticate/{providerKey}"] = parameters =&amp;gt;
              {
                  Session[SessionGuidKey] = Guid.NewGuid();
                  Uri uri =
                      authenticationService.
                          RedirectToAuthenticationProvider(
                              parameters.providerKey,
                              Session[SessionGuidKey].ToString());

                  return Response.AsRedirect(uri.AbsoluteUri);
              };

       Get["/AuthenticateCallback"] = parameters =&amp;gt;
              {
                  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Query.providerKey))
                  {
                      throw new ArgumentNullException("providerKey");
                  }

                  // It's possible that a person might hit this resource directly, before any session value
                  // has been set. As such, we should just fake some state up, which will not match the
                  // CSRF check.
                  var existingState = (string)(Session[SessionGuidKey] ?? Guid.NewGuid().ToString());

                  var model = new AuthenticateCallbackViewModel();

                  var querystringParameters = new NameValueCollection();
                  foreach (var item in Request.Query)
                  {
                      querystringParameters.Add(item, Request.Query[item]);
                  }

                  try
                  {
                      model.AuthenticatedClient =
                          authenticationService.CheckCallback(Request.Query.providerKey,
                                                              querystringParameters,
                                                              existingState);
                  }
                  catch (Exception exception)
                  {
                      model.Exception = exception;
                  }

                  return View["AuthenticateCallback", model];
              };
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should hopefully be pretty self explanatory as that is the aim of the game but I will go through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly we need to setup our social network key and secret which was provided to us by registering an app at the relevant site. We then setup a IAuthenticationProvider class for Twitter, Google &amp;amp; Facebook with the key, secret and callback URL that the social network will make request to after login. We then register our providers with a IAuthenticationService class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then setup our IOC container to use authenticationService so that when our modules like Home take a dependency of IAuthenticationService it will use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our root route provides a login page with hyperlinks to the RedirectToAuthenticate route. For example, using Twitter it will be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://mydomain.com/RedirectToAuthenticate/Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We create an item in our session so that it can be retrieved later when &lt;a href="http://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; calls the callback URL. This is so we can validate(if needs be) that its a valid request and not some cheeky hacker. We then use the IAuthenticationService to redirect to the social network login page based on the value of providerKey argument. This could also be Facebook or Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user is redirected to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and logs in and then gets directed back to our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our AuthenticateCallback route then creates a NameValueCollection from the querystring parameters and passes the providerKey (Twitter,Facebook,Google), NameValueCollection and Session value to the IAuthenticationService to validate all is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so it creates a view model and passes it to the view and in this example shows us the logged in user’s details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that was pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I want to play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code is over at &lt;a href="https://github.com/PureKrome/World-Domination.Web.Authentication"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and is written by Pure.Krome or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lara_eagle"&gt;Lara Eagle&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer (same person). It’s also available on &lt;a href="http://nuget.org/packages/World-Domination.Web.Authentication"&gt;Nuget&lt;/a&gt;. Its name you ask? World-Domination.Web.Authentication&lt;/p&gt;

This obviously means you have to hit your SMTP server each time, open your email client and check your emails each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Papercut&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through my Twitter timeline I saw &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt; asking about the app that you can use to test sending emails from your application.&lt;/p&gt;

This obviously means you have to hit your SMTP server each time, open your email client and check your emails each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Papercut&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading through my Twitter timeline I saw &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt; asking about the app that you can use to test sending emails from your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/tweet.png" alt="TheCodeJunkie Tweet" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, I kept an eye on my timeline and found that the application in question was &lt;a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/"&gt;Papercut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms you put Papercut on a machine (most likely your development machine) and in your code set the SMTP host to be the IP Address of where Papercut is running and fire up your application and watch Papercut notify you from the system tray that it’s recevied a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/Untitled.png" alt="Papertray System Tray Icon" title="Papertray System Tray Icon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Papertray System Tray Icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets open it up and see what it says!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/raw-620x330.png" alt="Raw View" title="Raw View" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raw View&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/images/blogpostimages/body-620x330.png" alt="Body View" title="Body View" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Body View&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested this with a C# application and a Node.js application. If you don’t believe me, here’s the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static void Main(string[] args)
{
    MailMessage message = new MailMessage("Jonathan Channon ", "tim.cook@apple.com")
    {
        Subject = "iPhone",
        Body = "I would like a free iPhone for work. My boss won't let me have one. How about it?",
        BodyEncoding = Encoding.UTF8
    };

    message.Bcc.Add("boss@company.com");
    SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("127.0.0.1");
    NetworkCredential info = new NetworkCredential("mail@jonathanchannon.com", "reallysecurepassword");
    client.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network;
    client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
    client.Credentials = info;
    try
    {
        client.Send(message);
    }
    catch(Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport("SMTP");

var mailOptions = {
    from: "Jonathan Channon ",
    to: "tim.cook@apple.com",
    cc: "boss@company.com",
    subject: "iPhone",
    text: "I would like a free iPhone for work. My boss won't let me have one. How about it?",
    html: "I would like a free iPhone for work. My boss won't let me have one. How about it?"
};

smtpTransport.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, response){
    if(error)
    {
        console.log(error);
    }else
    {
        console.log("Message sent: " %2B response.message);
    }

    smtpTransport.close();
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a great little app and a real time saver. I highly recommend that you check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also offer a web based version called &lt;a href="http://dummysmtp.com/"&gt;DummySMTP&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to test an almost live copy of your application but DummySMTP captures the emails sent out to customers, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did play with node.js about a year ago where I setup a TCP listener to listen to a TCP Server on the network broadcasting XML messages, I then took these, formatted them to JSON and passed it to a browser using &lt;a href="http://socket.io/"&gt;Socket.IO&lt;/a&gt;. It was pretty cool but the project never came to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I thought I would re-visit and setup a proper development environment on my Mac at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many editors/IDE’s that you can use for node.js development such as Vim, Eclipse, WebStorm, Aptana Studio, Emacs and Cloud9 IDE.

&lt;p&gt;Coming from a mainly IDE based background I started to find things a bit hard going however ST2 allows plugins to be used to make the user experience a lot nicer.  Below are a list of plugins I have installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from a mainly IDE based background I started to find things a bit hard going however ST2 allows plugins to be used to make the user experience a lot nicer.  Below are a list of plugins I have installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter"&gt;Bracket Highlighter&lt;/a&gt; - highlights start/end brackets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat"&gt;JsFormat&lt;/a&gt; - tidies code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter"&gt;SublimeLinter&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint"&gt;node-jshint&lt;/a&gt; - tells you if your code is any good or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tanepiper/SublimeText-Nodejs"&gt;SublimeText-NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; – provides node.js autocomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jfromaniello/Grandson-of-Obsidian"&gt;Grandson Of Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; - ST2 theme using Consolas font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set it up exactly how I have it you need to go to Preferences-&gt;Settings-User and copy &amp;amp; paste the below in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/son-of-obsidian.tmTheme",
    "dictionary": "Packages/Language - English/en_GB.dic",
    "ignored_packages":
    [
      "Vintage"
    ],
    "font_face": "Consolas",
    "font_size": 13
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find setting up SublimeLinter a bit tricky as I wanted it to use the “use strict”; option. &lt;em&gt;Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function DoCode()
{
  message = "Hi";
  console.log(message);  //Without strict mode you would not get any warnings that message is not defined.
}

//With strict mode on, this is what you should have
function DoCode()
{
  var message = "Hi";
  console.log(message);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My settings for SublimeLinter are below and should be added to Preferences-&gt;Package Settings-&gt;SublimeLinter-&gt;Settings-User&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "sublimelinter_popup_errors_on_save": true,
    "jshint_options":
    {
        "globalstrict": true,
        "node": true,
        "es5": true
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration will popup warnings when you save the file and will allow you to put “use strict”; at the top of every file. This global definition is not allowed by default and it should be put in every function which I think is unnecessary. I also think “use strict”; should be turned on by default without the need for it to be declared but there may be more to it than that as I’m just a newbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From Scratch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are completely new to Node then its probably worth taking a look at their website but if you want to start developing web sites straight away I highly recommend taking a look at the course &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=expressjs"&gt;Web Development with ExpressJS&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri"&gt;@hhariri&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://Pluralsight.com"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;.  I found it very informative and helped me start this little project. Also read &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/robashton"&gt;@robashton&lt;/a&gt; blog post called &lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/robashton/2012/09/03/keeping-js-sane/"&gt;Keeping JS Sane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all new pet projects I come up with I find you always need an idea to write an app to use the technology you want to play with. I ended up choosing Formula 1 as I managed to find an API that provided lots of statistics. I’m still not entirely sure what this app will end up becoming so if anyone has any ideas and/or wants to use node.js get in touch and maybe we can collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into detail about how this &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/NodeF1"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; works as you can browse the source code and watch &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hhariri"&gt;@hhariri&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=expressjs"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; to get further information but I’ll just show a couple of snippets to “whet the appetite” (yes, that is how you spell “whet”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our main application file we set up the routes like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var express = require('express'),
    home = require('./routes/index.js');

app.configure(function(){
  app.set('view engine', 'jade');
});

var app = express();

app.get('/current-schedule', home.currentSchedule)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define what we are going to use, we configure our app using express and setup a route that points to a function called currentSchedule in the ./routes/index.js file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in our ./routes/index.js file we configure what the response will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var request = require('request');

exports.currentSchedule = function(req, response) {

    var date = new Date();
    var year = date.getUTCFullYear();

    request.get("http://ergast.com/api/f1/" + year + ".json", function(err, res, body) {
        if(!err) {
            var model = JSON.parse(body);

            response.render("current/currentSchedule", {
                title: "Current Race Schedule",
                currentUrl: req.path,
                RaceData: model.MRData.RaceTable
            });
        }
    });

};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we define what modules we are going to use. To expose our currentSchedule function we use the exports keyword. This function has a request and response argument that we can interrogate if needs be. We need to determine the current year, make a separate request to the API, which also exposes a error object, a response object but also the body of content returned. We put that into a JSON object and then call a view with a title, currentUrl and our data as a view model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its then up to our view to display this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ul  
    each item in RaceData.Races
        - var raceDate = new Date(item.date).toDateString();
        li #{item.raceName},  #{item.Circuit.Location.locality}, #{item.Circuit.Location.country}
            = raceDate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our view uses the &lt;a href="http://jade-lang.com/"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; view engine. This took me a while to get used to as it is based on indentation in your files. PRO Tip: Always use tabs to make things easier and use the View-&gt;Indentation-&gt;Convert Indentation to Tabs option in ST2. Lets just say it took me a few hours to get somethig working. Things were lined up but they were a mixture of spaces and tabs but I couldn’t see that in ST2. If anyone knows how to display all symbols in ST2 like &lt;a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; does then please let me know. It would have saved a lot of time and swear words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we setup an unordered list and for each item in our RaceData.Races element in our view model we format the date and output various bits of information about the current schedule. The hyphen in Jade allows you to do code behind and the #{} is how you tell the view to output data from the view model. We don’t always have to do it like that, we could do li= item.raceName but in our scenario the above was needed, I assume because of the code behind logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that gives you a bit of insight into node.js and Express. If you have any suggestions about moving my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/NodeF1"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; forwards then let me know. I would like to add forms authentication, validation, unit tests and a database to see how these things work in node.js. Moving over to a text editor and a dynamic language is certainly a lot different to using Visual Studio and C#. Its a classic case of the bell arch learning curve, where you start out excited, then seriously frustrated and then I hope you peek and start to love it. I’m surprised at how much I have actually enjoyed it, a bit like taking the stabilisers off your bike, there’s certainly a freedom to not using Visual Studio. I think I have passed the extreme frustration stage in what I have done so far anyway but no doubt I’m sure I will hit more frustration as the application progresses but I think the key to it is definitely having a half decent editor to help in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 9th Oct 2012:&lt;/strong&gt; I realised that I didn’t mention debugging. I will keep this short because I researched it and I believe this is the best way. You need to install &lt;a href="https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector"&gt;node-inspector&lt;/a&gt; which gives you a node debugger that uses the Google Chrome developer tools UI. You also need &lt;a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon"&gt;nodemon&lt;/a&gt; which runs your app and when you make changes in your script it will restart node automatically. To run this side by side, you can fire up terminal and run &lt;em&gt;nodemon –debug app.js &amp;amp; node-inspector&lt;/em&gt; and that will work a treat. I wanted to streamline this a bit more so I looked into the &lt;a href="http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/reference/build_systems.html"&gt;Build Systems&lt;/a&gt; ST2 offers. This &lt;a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/custom-sublime-text-build-systems-for-popular-tools-and-languages"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; also provides some more information. Essentially what we want to do is have a key binding that will put our app into debug mode and allow us to step through our lines of code. In ST2, go to Project-&amp;gt;Save Project As and choose a name. This will create a project file which can add your build system for the project. (You do not have to do this as your build system can apply globally if you want.) Add the following piece of code in your .sublime-project file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"build_systems":
[
    {
        "name": "GiveMeAName",
        "shell": true,
        "cmd": ["nodemon --debug $project_path/app.js &amp;amp;amp; node-inspector"],
        "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
        "selector": "source.js"
    }
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save it, in ST2, go to Tools-&amp;gt;Build System and select the option you entered in the “name” element. Now press Cmd%2BB and you’ll see a console appear in ST2 telling you that nodemon and node-inspector are running. If you really wanted, you could modify the key bindings ST2 offers and change Cmd%2BB to F5 but I’ll leave that one to you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before that post was published I was working on a program that required the file system. All you good developers are going to know that the file system is a dependency and dependencies are bad and this post will probably be a bit like preaching to the choir however I thought it was worth posting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have a a method similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void DoSomethingCool()
{
  //do some stuff now write to file

  FileInfo f = new FileInfo("C:\Mytext.txt")
  using(StreamWriter w = f.CreateText())
  {
    w.WriteLine("This blog post is cool");
    w.Close();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are writing to a file to record something and need to test your method. Remember, unit tests are supposed to be fast. Typically anything that writes to a database or a file system will be slow however, we also have the problem that our method is now dependent on the file system and dependencies are bad. Wouldn’t it be handy if we could make FileInfo a representation of an interface.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically anything that writes to a database or a file system will be slow however, we also have the problem that our method is now dependent on the file system and dependencies are bad. Wouldn’t it be handy if we could make FileInfo a representation of an interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplest way is to hit F12 in Visual Studio and see what interface FileInfo implements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public sealed class FileInfo : FileSystemInfo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, OK lets hit F12 on FileSystemInfo and we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class FileSystemInfo : MarshalByRefObject, ISerializable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like the FileInfo class does not implement any interface so now we’re stuck, we have a hard coded dependency and our unit tests are going to be slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is we’ll have to create an interface for all the methods and properties that we are going to use that are in FileInfo. Not too bad I suppose, we’re only using CreateText in the example above so we create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface IFileInfo
{
  StreamWriter CreateText();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now pass in IFileInfo to our class’ constructor and hopefully use it like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass
{
  private readonly IFileInfo fileInfo;

  public MyClass(IFileInfo fileInfo)
  {
    this.fileInfo = fileInfo;
  }

  public void DoSomethingCool()
  {
    //do some stuff now write to file

    using(StreamWriter w = fileInfo.CreateText())
    {
      w.WriteLine("This blog post is cool");
      w.Close();
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could then use &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/moq/"&gt;Moq&lt;/a&gt; in our unit test to successfully mock the filesystem and ensure our method writes to the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[TestFixture]
public class MyTestClass
{
  [Test]
  public void DoSomethingCool_WhenCalled_WritesToFile()
  {
    //Arrange
    var fileMock = new Moq.Mock&amp;lt;IFileInfo&amp;gt;();
    var myClass = new MyClass(fileMock.Object);

    //Act
    myClass.DoSomethingCool();

    //Assert
    fileMock.Verify(x =&amp;amp;gt; x.CreateText());
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’ve probably spotted there are three issues here. Firstly FileInfo expects a path in its constructor which we haven’t supplied, secondly all we’ve actually verified in our test is that CreateText is called and finally DoSomethingCool still has a dependency on StreamWriter which uses the underlying file system. The solution is to abstract the StreamWriter yourself so the unit test is testing that data is written to the file and do something about the FileInfo dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be done, not a problem, but wouldn’t it be nice if someone has already done that for you? Luckily they have and its called &lt;a href="https://github.com/tathamoddie/System.IO.Abstractions"&gt;System.IO.Abstractions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote from the website "&lt;em&gt;At the core of the library is IFileSystem and FileSystem. Instead of calling methods like File.ReadAllText directly, use IFileSystem.File.ReadAllText. We have exactly the same API, except that ours is injectable and testable.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you can now do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IFileSystem fileSystem;

    public MyClass(IFileSystem  fileSystem)
    {
      this.fileSystem = fileSystem;
    }

    public void DoSomethingCool()
    {
      //do some stuff now write to file

      var file = fileSystem.FileInfo.FromFileName("C:\Mytext.txt");
      using(IStreamWriter writer = file.CreateText())
      {
        writer.WriteLine("This blog post is cool");
        writer.Close();
      }
    }
}

[TestFixture]
public class MyTestClass
{
    [Test]
    public void DoSomethingCool_WhenCalled_WritesToFile()
    {
      //Arrange
      var filesystemMock = new Moq.Mock&amp;lt;IFileSystem&amp;gt;();
      var fileinfoFactory = new Moq.Mock&amp;lt;IFileInfoFactory&amp;gt;();
      var fileinfoMock = new Moq.Mock&amp;lt;FileInfoBase&amp;gt;();
      var streamWriterMock = new Moq.Mock&amp;lt;IStreamWriter&amp;gt;();

      var myClass = new MyClass(filesystemMock.Object);

      fileinfoMock.Setup(x =&amp;gt; x.CreateText()).Returns(streamWriterMock.Object);
      fileinfoFactory.Setup(x =&amp;gt; x.FromFileName("C:\Mytext.txt")).Returns(fileinfoMock.Object);
      filesystemMock.Setup(x =&amp;gt; x.FileInfo).Returns(fileinfoFactory.Object);

      //Act
      myClass.DoSomethingCool();

      //Assert
      streamWriterMock.Verify(x =&amp;gt; x.WriteLine("This blog post is cool"));
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now still verify your calls to file are getting called but on top of that you can verify the content written to file all without the need for a file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some of you may not like all the mocks arranged in the unit test so luckily for you System.IO.Abstractions has a set of its own mocks that you can use. This means we have to modify our class slightly to make the filesystem public so we can read what is written to file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class MyClass
{
    public readonly IFileSystem filesystem;

    public MyClass(IFileSystem filesystem)
    {
      this.filesystem = filesystem;
    }

    public void DoSomethingCool()
    {
      //do some stuff now write to file

      using(var w = filesystem.FileInfo.FromFileName("C:\\Mytext.txt").CreateText())
      {
        w.WriteLine("This blog post is cool");
        w.Close();
      }
    }
}

[TestFixture]
public class MyTestClass
{
    [Test]
    public void DoSomethingCool_WhenCalled_WritesToFile()
    {
      //Arrange
      var fileData = new MockFileData("");
      var fileSystem = new MockFileSystem(new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, MockFileData&amp;gt;
      {
          { "C:\\Mytext.txt", fileData }
      });

      var myClass = new MyClass(fileSystem);

      //Act
      myClass.DoSomethingCool();

      //Assert
      MockFileInfoFactory factory = (MockFileInfoFactory)myClass.filesystem.FileInfo;
      var result = factory.FileInfo.OpenText().ReadToEnd();
      Assert.AreEqual("This blog post is cool", result);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a matter of preference which you prefer but either way hopefully this illustrates how and why you should abstract the file system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to point out is that these file system calls should be in their own class and that DoSomethingCool should be calling something like IFileSystemLogger.Log() which is where the file system calls should be. This illustrates the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the functionality outlined above is not available yet in the master branch of System.IO.Abstractions but it has been submitted as a pull request from me so hopefully it will be merged soon. I’ve already had one PR merged and it was quick, built and released on NuGet within the hour. I encourage you to take a look at this project and try and contribute. There are a few quirks, for example, I wanted to use Moq v4 syntax in my tests but couldn’t work it out, not sure if that’s me or System.IO.Abstractions. Anyhow the more people that get involved the better it will become.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by pointing out there are many opinions about the answer to this question. You will have yours and I have mine, that’s called freedom of speech. I would like to hear your opinions so leave it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain that I have had 4 jobs in the last 10-11 years. 3 of those were via recruitment agents. They check your skills, tick them off and pass you over to the employer if they match and hopefully you get an interview. That process has happened to me in each of those 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have read my previous blog posts you’ll know I have spent the last year reading a lot of other peoples code and learning all the best practices I can in a bid to become a better software developer as well as give back to the developer community where I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a couple of months porting &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me"&gt;NerdDinner over to NancyFX&lt;/a&gt; I realised that I had not looked at &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc"&gt;ASP.Net MVC 4&lt;/a&gt; and the new features built into it. I felt slightly strange at that point as I was usually an early adopter of these things keen to check out the new stuff. I think this was partly due to the fact I had spent a lot of time learning &lt;a href="http://www.nancyfx.org"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt; and really quite enjoying the framework and interacting with the small community of people who use Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a couple of months porting &lt;a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me"&gt;NerdDinner over to NancyFX&lt;/a&gt; I realised that I had not looked at &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc"&gt;ASP.Net MVC 4&lt;/a&gt; and the new features built into it. I felt slightly strange at that point as I was usually an early adopter of these things keen to check out the new stuff.

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I had recognized that my skill set was missing a checkbox to tick off but after using Nancy there were a few areas of MVC that I no longer liked but I knew I would have to learn MVC 4 to ensure I stay up to date. This realization had me thinking and I asked &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/GrumpyDev"&gt;@GrumpyDev&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lead developers of NancyFX that during his day to day development if he was in a position as an architect to make his developers use NancyFX instead of MVC. Part of his response was &lt;em&gt;“we very much suffer from using new and shiny Microsoft stuff, and following "best practices" without having a clue why”&lt;/em&gt;. This reinforced my growing suspicion that maybe OSS work was for the tinkerer developer, the modern day man who sits at a computer tinkering away instead of doing stuff in his shed because as far as I can tell most companies recruiting people want their experience to be on a MS stack. Unfortunately you don’t see many adverts asking for NancyFX, FubuMVC or even RavenDB experience. As @GrumpyDev states, I’m not sure why this is either because within the community there is a push for people to learn as much as possible and use the latest, greatest and alternative technologies whilst those that are employing just want their developers to have a full understanding of Microsoft technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept these thoughts floating around my little brain for a week or two and whilst in Jabbr &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/invalid_arg"&gt;@invalid_arg&lt;/a&gt; was discussing how he was playing with &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and I asked him if he thought there was many opportunities out there for Node.js developers and it started a myriad of opinions about OSS, new languages/frameworks on the block and career possibilites which I’ll try and outline. The reason I make reference to this is because the discussion was not just about OSS but all the new and alternative frameworks and languages out there so the title of this post was a bit of a headline grabber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some that believed that if you were smart you would be able to get a job even if you had no experience which was counterattacked with you would never have been asked to the interview if the employer saw you had no experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pointed out that if you worked at Microsoft they drop you in at the deep end and ask you to build something even if you had no experience in that area but is Microsoft a fair example of “most” companies employing you and then asking you to build something on the fly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One guy posted “if you have a heart problem would you go to a doctor who has never done surgery before?” implying that the doctor was smart so could therefore pick up heart surgery skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point of view said that “I would rather employ a smart guy with enthusiasm than a dumb guy with 5 years experience and no enthusiasm” which I think a lot of people agreed with however, how do you measure whether a guy is smart enough in a typical interview environment? Would he have even been asked to interview?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also an opinion that if he was smart he could be moulded to become a good developer in that specific area of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Microsoft as an example it was noted that forward thinking employers may take the smart guy approach because they can see the potential and with investment will have a great return. I wonder how many companies like this exist though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another argument if a developer who only knows C# gets fired today and has a mortgage and family to look after he does not have the luxury of spending two months to learn another language to get another job, he needs one now. There may be companies out there but I believe in rare circumstances that may employ you and ask you to build something even if you don’t have the experience to do it which would provide you the ability to learn on the job and gain more experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously a lot of opinions around this subject and every one is valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did spot that a few people said they had been head hunted because they were known from their OSS work obviously by developers in a company keeping their eyes and ears out. It could be argued that potentially that this might be a good place to work if they know you by these skills and are open and embracing of your OSS mindset. Luckily my current employer knows I like to code outside of work hours and my boss is accepting of this even though I do badger him about adopting new things constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is my opinion of whether OSS is good for your career? I believe that it exposes you to new things which is beneficial, you gain more experience, you adopt best practices and if you’re lucky you become well known for your OSS work and people can see you have a certain skill and/or are a smart person which may open you up to being head hunted however, there is only a finite amount of time and my current experience has taught me I need to keep on top of the MS stack to improve my career so therefore I have to try and find a balance for MS/main stream learning and other OSS areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know your experience and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

Why?"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, NancyFX was my first port of call in my OSS adventure.  The reason I had come across it was by following &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/squidge"&gt;@squidge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cranialstrain"&gt;@cranialstrain&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.  At the time they were talking about it quite a bit so I thought I’d take a look.  I was also keeping track of lots of people talking about &lt;a href="http://ravendb.net"&gt;RavenDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is NancyFX?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the official docs this explains NancyFX:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This means that everything in Nancy is setup to have sensible defaults and conventions, instead of making you jump through hoops and go through configuration hell just to get up and running. With Nancy you can go from zero to website in a matter of minutes. Literally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With Nancy you can go from zero to website in a matter of minutes. Literally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ASP.Net MVC was first introduced to the world I was hooked on the framework, it seemed so easy and logical in comparison to ASP.Net Webforms plus it had lots more &lt;a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.  NancyFX took these benefits and added lots more to them. For example creating a website was very easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HelloModule : NancyModule
{
  public HelloModule()
  {
    Get["/"] = parameters =&amp;gt; "Hello World";
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have experience using MVC and want to check out how Nancy compares check out &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jhovgaard"&gt;@jhovgaard&lt;/a&gt; series of posts titled &lt;em&gt;“From ASP.Net MVC to Nancy”&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://jhovgaard.net/from-aspnet-mvc-to-nancy-part-1"&gt;Part1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jhovgaard.net/from-aspnet-mvc-to-nancy-part-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://jhovgaard.net/from-aspnet-mvc-to-nancy-part-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is RavenDB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RavenDB is a transactional, open-source Document Database written in .NET. Data in RavenDB is stored schema-less as JSON documents, and can be queried efficiently using Linq queries from .NET code or using RESTful API using other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that you no longer have to rely on a RDBMS as your backend data store for your .Net projects. RavenDB is part of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL"&gt;NoSQL&lt;/a&gt; movement that, in simple terms, stores key-value pairs and does not store data in relational tables. It is also very quick in data retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Two birds, one stone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with anything software related the best way to learn something is to write an application that uses that specific piece of technology. So I sent out a tweet something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;“I need to find a reason to use NancyFX and RavenDB”.&lt;/em&gt;Two minutes later I got a response from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lead developers of NancyFX saying he had wanted to port &lt;a href="http://nerddinner.com"&gt;NerdDinner&lt;/a&gt; to use NancyFX but had not had the time and wondered if I would be interested in doing that and using RavenDB as the data store.  I instantly said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first jump into actually contributing to OSS and I was very excited and honoured.  I thought this was amazing, I thought I’d made it and believed this was going to change everything.  I went home and told my wife that my newest pet project was going to be this and she gave her usual supportive but ambiguous “that’s nice dear” type response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got stuck in by browsing the NerdDinner source code and began getting the Razor views working with Nancy. I started converting all the ASP.Net MVC controllers into Nancy Modules and then had an idea for Nancy.  A domain specific language (DSL).  Nancy uses various ways to capture querystring arguments, one of them being regex.  To cut a long story short I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/jchannon/Nancy.RouteHelpers"&gt;Nancy.Routehelpers&lt;/a&gt; and put it on NuGet.  It was a way to define routes in the modules without the need for using Regex because lets be honest no-one &lt;em&gt;likes&lt;/em&gt; using Regex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It meant I could use this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HomeModule : NancyModule
{
  public HomeModule()
  {
    //Yay! Readable routes :)
    Get[Route.Root().AnyIntAtLeastOnce("id")] = parameters =&amp;amp;gt;
    {
      return View["Index"];
    };

    //Boooo! Regex :(
    Get["/(?[\d]%2B)"] = parameters =&amp;amp;gt;
    {
      return View["Index"];
    };
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now by helping out and learning stuff at the same time I was already contributing to the community with my own ideas, even though in the small league however, it was all very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the logic started to wind up and I needed to put in the data store I was having teething trouble with Raven.  A quick tweet asking for help and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/@philjoness88"&gt;@philjones88&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue.  As we were chatting we both realised we only live 40 miles apart! Small world but no matter how large, another great sign of the active community willing to help. I’ve gone on to chat to Phil numerous times and he’s been a huge help not just in RavenDB. I would highly recommend him for anyone needing any contract work as he is a true professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily integrating RavenDB was fairly painless, if I did have any quick questions I would pester &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/@philjoness88"&gt;@philjones88&lt;/a&gt; or use RavenDB’s &lt;a href="http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/RavenDB"&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt; room or use the official &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ravendb"&gt;RavenDB Google group&lt;/a&gt;. The only two areas that stand out from memory that caused a few scratches of the head were indexing and clearing out documents of a certain age. The latter was needed due to the database being on a free account with &lt;a href="https://ravenhq.com/"&gt;RavenHQ&lt;/a&gt; as it had a database size limit of 15mb.  I’ll post the snippet here just in case anyone comes by and wants to  use it to delete all their documents from RavenDB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void CleanUpDB(IDocumentSession DocSession)
{
    var configInfo = DocSession.Load("DinnerParty/Config");

    if (configInfo == null)
    {
        configInfo = [new][18] Config();
        configInfo.Id = "DinnerParty/Config";
        configInfo.LastTruncateDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-48); //No need to delete data if config doesnt exist but setup ready for next time

        DocSession.Store(configInfo);
        DocSession.SaveChanges();

        return;
    }
    else
    {
        if ((DateTime.Now - configInfo.LastTruncateDate).TotalHours &amp;lt; 24)
            return;

        configInfo.LastTruncateDate = DateTime.Now;
        DocSession.SaveChanges();

        //If database size &amp;gt; 15mb or 1000 documents delete documents older than a week

#if DEBUG
        var jsonData = RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.JsonRequestFactory.CreateHttpJsonRequest(null, "http://localhost:8080/database/size", "GET", RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.Credentials, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.Conventions).ReadResponseJson();

#else
        var jsonData = RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.JsonRequestFactory.CreateHttpJsonRequest(null, "https://1.ravenhq.com/databases/DinnerParty-DinnerPartyDB/database/size", "GET", RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.Credentials, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.Conventions).ReadResponseJson();

#endif
        int dbSize = int.Parse(jsonData.SelectToken("DatabaseSize").ToString());
        long docCount = RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.DatabaseCommands.GetStatistics().CountOfDocuments;


        if (docCount &amp;gt; 1000 || dbSize &amp;gt; 15000000) //its actually 14.3mb but goood enough
        {

            RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore.DatabaseCommands.DeleteByIndex("Raven/DocumentsByEntityName",
                new IndexQuery
                {
                    Query = DocSession.Advanced.LuceneQuery()
                    .WhereEquals("Tag", "Dinners")
                    .AndAlso()
                    .WhereLessThan("LastModified", DateTime.Now.AddDays(-7)).ToString()
                },
                false);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One neat feature of the indexes within RavenDB although initially a tad confusing is the ability to define them in C# so when your application starts you can make a call to &lt;strong&gt;Raven.Client.Indexes.IndexCreation.CreateIndexes&lt;/strong&gt; and it will apply them to your database. Slightly cooler than a RDBMS way of creating an index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It’s all in the name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As development was winding up we needed to decide upon a name instead of NerdDinner. A couple of ideas were thrown about, FancyNancy, Party with Nancy, Dinner with Nancy, all pretty lame so &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/thecodejunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt; came up with DinnerParty and that’s what we went with plus its a bit more sophisticated than NerdDinner &lt;img src="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue was having a logo for DinnerParty, a large feat for someone who has no design skills whatsoever. I appreciate good design but have no ability in that area, in fact I’m pretty sure a 3 year old has more skills than me. I went through various rubbish designs and it went back and forth in deliberation via Jabbr but in the end the decision was mine and we went what we have today. I apologise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time I was finishing development &lt;a href="http://www.windowsazure.com"&gt;Windows Azure&lt;/a&gt; had made a big change to its offerings and were doing all sorts of cool things including free websites! This was another tech toy I could play with so I signed up for an account so I could host DinnerParty. It was all very shiny and fun however I had found a &lt;a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazurewebsitespreview/thread/9ee30e74-7546-4c1e-ac8c-0235e1589920"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt;. It wouldn’t let me store a connection string to an external RavenDB database which was hosted at &lt;a href="https://ravenhq.com/"&gt;RavenHQ&lt;/a&gt;. Up went a forum post and a few back and forths and conversations on Twitter with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidebbo"&gt;@davidebbo&lt;/a&gt; and he managed to get it working!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other cool features that Windows Azure was touting was “&lt;a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/publishing-with-git/#Step5"&gt;Git Deploy&lt;/a&gt;“, the ability to use Git to deploy the website. Essentially it allowed me to push my source code to Windows Azure and then it would build the code and publish the compiled project to the website. Absolutely brilliant! No more FTP-ing, no more Web Deploy projects, this was genius at work. However there were two steps involved to keep the Github repository and the live website up to date, i) Push changes to Github ii) Push changes to Azure. Not a major problem at all however, those eager beavers at Microsoft have managed to get this down to one step with improved &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/09/17/announcing-great-improvements-to-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx"&gt;Continuous Deployment&lt;/a&gt; so that when your changes are pushed to Github your Windows Azure account will pick this up, build the project and publish to your website. I highly recommend people check out the new Windows Azure offerings even if you just use the free websites as they offer a lot of cool functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Go Live!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code was done, the database was wired up, source control was working, website hosting was in place and a deployment strategy configured. D-day! Excited and nervous at the same time I made DinnerParty live to the world. That moment when it might all go horribly wrong, people would look at the code and laugh or use the website and it would fail. Oh well, no going back now, my time to shine! Luckily it all went well, it was publicised on Jabbr and Twitter and people started to look at it and the odd person played with the website. In my excitement I approached &lt;a href="http://ayende.com/blog"&gt;Oren Eini&lt;/a&gt; (or Ayende Rahien as others may know him as) about some publicity about this new port of NerdDinner. Oren is the lead developer of RavenDB so I thought he may be interested. He was very open to the idea and offered to publicise it via a &lt;a href="http://ayende.com/blog/156609/reviewing-dinner-party-ndash-nerd-dinner-ported-to-ravendb-on-ravenhq"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which I thought was nice of him. I read his article a week before it was due to be published and he pointed out a few things which I took on-board and changed before the blog post went live. At that point I was slightly nervous due to the things he had spotted, what else were people going to find? The day came when it was published and apparently I had faired well in the review according to other people as he is known for speaking his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got word of another &lt;a href="http://www.dvloop.com/effective-ravendb-session-management/"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;from the guy who had helped design the NancyFX logo. He was looking at the way DinnerParty was using the per request/per RavenDB session architecture and offered an alternative approach if one was using service layers. DinnerParty only needed access to the RavenDB session in the modules so it didn’t take that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reviews of developers code their natural instinct is to go defensive however, after counting to ten and looking at both reviews there was room for improvements and room for discussion in DinnerParty. Its hard to sit back and do that when you spend a lot of time developing something of your own and a lot of people have the tendency to just ignore criticism but I feel this is one area that you can progress as a developer. Letting others look at your code and explain why another approach maybe better is one of the key ways you learn. You don’t have to agree with an alternative approach but it helps your perception if there is more than one way you can look at it rather than stick with the “my way or the highway” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DinnerParty Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months have passed since DinnerParty went live and after the initial reviews and feeling of excitement what has happened? Well various large multi-national corporations approached me to go and work for them with a salary of $10m, a private jet, speedboat, holiday villas and unlimited Apple products. Not bad eh!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my imagination took hold there. DinnerParty the website is still up and running at , the &lt;a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/DinnerParty/"&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; was moved under the NancyFX central repository and I think its become a minor port of call as a reference app for new users using NancyFX to look at, see &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11532523/nancy-framework-sample-application"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11253466/84539"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I have also gained a lot of experience using RavenDB and NancyFX and that was my goal at the start of the project so I think I can feel happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I made it? No.  I wasn’t suddenly being pestered by lots of people offering me highly paid jobs but it felt good to have done something for the community and to be part of something for a while.  That I believe is the key to it all.  You’re giving something which makes you feel good but you are also apart of something with other people interested in the same thing as you and also hopefully making a difference that adds to the feeling of belonging and by rolling all of that into one defines the word ‘community’.&lt;/p&gt;

Why?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;So here I am, Jonathan Channon, blogger.  I never saw the point of blogging before so why now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read and spoken to many people regarding blogging who were all in favour of it.  I would always argue that I don’t have time, I have nothing to blog about or I’m not that insane to start blogging about stuff I barely understand just so the masses can come and hurl abuse at my ignorance.  However I recently read an &lt;a href="http://buildstarted.com/2012/08/28/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-my-community/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/buildstarted"&gt;Ben Dornis&lt;/a&gt; titled “How I learned to stop worrying and love my community”.  He outlined all the reasons why a lot of people don’t publish their code and don’t publish their thoughts online. I thought he was being modest, the man is clearly talented at what he does so he didn’t have to worry however, someone like me still had these fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I have made an effort to start contributing to open source software and to take the forked road away from Microsoft.  I found lots of things and this increased my appetite for learning. If you’re not learning you become stagnant in my opinion and you become bored,  more bored and so on until you find yourself completely out of touch from the peers around you.  On the whole its not good to be ignorant in software development, there are fashions that come and go but you have a duty to keep up to date with today’s best practices.  I have learnt many things from dipping a toe in OSS, I have begun following more and more people in the software development industry on Twitter listening to their discussions and at times joining in.  I realised that I’m not actually scared of asking questions, I just have to word them a certain way just to protect my ego.  In fact I think I’m possibly one of those annoying people who just keep asking questions until I get something straight in my head.  Unfortunately that’s the way I am, things pop up in my mind and then I try to find the answer and if I don’t find it quickly I start badgering people until I get that answer or blurting out things on Twitter.  That’s because I’m terribly impatient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my attempts to be part of the software community I came across &lt;a href="http://jabbr.net"&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt;, essentially an online chat room made up of various rooms discussing different things.  This appealed to the impatient me, I could ask questions and get the answers quickly.  The more I used it the more I was hooked not just in consuming answers to my questions but reciprocally answering any questions others might have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found from this new path was that I was no longer scared of publishing code online and asking questions.  I had been using &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; for a few years and had never received any abuse or criticism from the questions I have asked so why did I think blogging would be any different?  The stuff I have put on Github has not resulted in any moments that made me think “I really need to take that code down” so I have bitten the bullet and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting yourself out there is daunting at first but the more you do the more you realise that there are a great bunch of people out there only too happy to share which encourages you to continue your learning.  One prime example I would like to single out in this area is the support given to the community by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grumpydev"&gt;@Grumpydev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodejunkie"&gt;@TheCodeJunkie&lt;/a&gt;, the lead developers of &lt;a href="http://nancyfx.org/"&gt;NancyFX&lt;/a&gt;.  I won’t go into depth about what NancyFX is, that’s another blog post, but what these guys illustrate is a dedication to encourage and support people wanting to learn NancyFX.  What this results in is more and more people wanting to help out the community which can only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my wise father used to say to me over my teenage years, “the more you put in, the more you get out” so I’m hoping that my continued presence on Twitter and now this blog and my meagre contributions to OSS will enable me to learn as much as I can handle and make me a better software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
