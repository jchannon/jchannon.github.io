      <div class="post-descr entry">
          <p>Whilst keeping my eye on what's going on in .NET Core v2 I came across some planned changes for ASP.NET Core regarding the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Routing/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing/RequestDelegateRouteBuilderExtensions.cs">routing</a>.  I had also read this <a href="https://www.strathweb.com/2017/01/building-microservices-with-asp-net-core-without-mvc/">blog post</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/filip_woj">Filip</a> about using the planned changes for microservices and a lightbulb went off in my head.  I thought to myself I wonder if I could adapt the new extensions to create Nancy-esque routing.  Turns out, I could!</p>

<h3>Sample</h3>

<pre><code>public class ActorsModule : BotwinModule
{
    public ActorsModule()
    {
        this.Get("/", async (req, res, routeData) =&gt;
        {
            await res.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

          <p>As you may or may not know I try to work on OSX as much as possible and with .Net that's quite painful to be honest.  Things are moving along nicely with Jetbrains Rider,
VSCode, Xamarin and Omnisharp.  I'll be honest, none of them are perfect and I often find myself using Visual Studio in a VM because it just works (yes, its clunky etc etc).
Recently, VSCode got a 1.3 release with some new features, tabs being one of them.  I never really got on with VSCode so dismissed it most of the time but this new release
opened my eyes a bit more and thought I'd give it a go.  Its C# support now runs on .Net Core RTM and most of my work at the moment is porting projects to .Net Core so it seemed
this would be worthwhile.  I've tried to setup keybindings that are the ones I know from Visual Studio and installed couple of extensions to make things easier and prettier.  </p>

<p>As VSCode is language agnostic the one thing I found was how to build .Net Core projects was a bit off.  For each project you have you have to configure a task runner.  VSCode tries to 
help you here and gives you a few languages to choose from.  For .Net Core it creates a <code>dotnet build</code> task.  The problem with this is that it runs that command from the workspace root, 
ie the folder where VSCode is opened.  What if you open it from the git root folder and your project(s) are under a src/MyProject folder?  It will fail as it cant find project.json.
What you can do is set the <code>cwd</code> to be a specific directory by hardcoding it in the task configuration but thats not great if you have multiple projects.  You could use some predefined
variables that VSCode provides eg/<code>${fileDirname}</code> but again if you are in a folder 4 levels deep that wont work either.

          <p>In our application at work we make use of various middleware and as we are making everything run on .Net Core the time has come to port said middleware to .Net Core.  If you don't already know ASP.Net Core has a bridge that allows you to use OWIN components in an ASP.Net Core application.  This will convert the HttpContext into a OWIN environment dictionary on input and then back again on output.</p>

<p>Lets take an example of some middleware</p>

<pre><code>public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly Func&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;, Task&gt; nextFunc;
    private readonly OwinUserMiddlewareOptions options;

    public OwinUserMiddleware(Func&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;, Task&gt; nextFunc, MyMiddlewareOptions options)
    {
        this.options = options;
        this.nextFunc = nextFunc;
    }

    public Task Invoke(IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; environment)
    {
        //Everything is awesome
        return nextFunc(environment);
    }
}

public static class MyMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IAppBuilder UseMyMiddleware(this IAppBuilder app, MyMiddlewareOptions options = null)
    {
        return app.Use(typeof(MyMiddleware), options);
    }
}

          <p>I've been interested in Hypermedia for quite a while.  I bugged <a href="http://twitter.com/darrelmiller">Darrel Miller</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gblock">Glenn Block</a> (Glenn Miller) so much so they created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbc9sDUxHqX60XJaTnNnKvI2mRighInDW">YouTube show</a> called "In The Mood for HTTP".  I bought their book <a href="http://webapibook.net/">"Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"</a>, I am waiting for <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037958.do">"RESTful Web Clients Enabling Reuse Through Hypermedia"</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/mamund">Mike Amundsen</a>, I have <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2015/08/07/hypermedia-and-nancyfx/index.html">written</a> about how to return different media types with NancyFX and I am looking at going to <a href="http://2016.uk.restfest.org/">restfest.org</a> in Edinburgh this year, a REST conference.  </p>

<p>The one thing that I have always discussed with Glenn Miller is that there seems, or from my perception, that there is a lot of emphasis on the server returning media types(HAL,Siren,JSON-LD, Collection+Json) and very little information about hypermedia clients.  The information that I have come across which is very little, again coulkd be due to my lack of Google-fu, seems to generate a mis-conception.  The mis-conception I have come across is that if you have an API that returns hypermedia then your client should be able to magically work with it.  It should know everything that is required to browse the API and discover its way around.  I never quite grasped how that was supposed to happen and was serioulsy confused.  I had seen a video that showed when the server returned its responses, using Javascript it would loop over all the properties in the payload and then display them in a HTML page.  The emphasis was that if new bits of data were added then they would appear magically in the UI.  That seemed like a nice feature but I still didn't quite get how it went from hitting the root of the API to finding its way into the guts of it.  The server would return links in the payload with "rels" and I was baffled how this magic client knew what to do with a rel or even how it knew what rels it would return.<br />

          <p>Nearly 2 years ago I was employed by <a href="http://www.vqcomms.com">VQ Communications</a> primarily because of my open source contributions to <a href="http://nancyfx.org">NancyFX</a>.  They had started work on a v2 of their flagship product and had begun work with Nancy and needed someone to help drive a HTTP API and architect a scaling solution as their v2 product was addressing a requirement they had for it cope with large volumes of traffic.  Also of interest to me was their aim to deliver all of this as a black box appliance to customers on a VM running a custom embedded version of Linux using Postgres as the database.  I would work four days a week remotely and go into the office one day a week.  They already had completely remote employees and since I have been there they have taken on more. There are lots more juicy technical examples in the stack I could go into however, this is not the point of this post.</p>
