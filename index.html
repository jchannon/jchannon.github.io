          <p>If you have been doing code changes and committing as you go and then look back at the changes you may see something you don’t like the look of. Assuming no-one has a copy of your code changes you can go back and modify the files at a certain point in time within your commit history.</p>

<p>I use Git Bash by default but the editor sucks compared to Sublime Text so first things first lets setup the Git editor.</p>

<p>For Sublime Text run this in the command line:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe'"
</code></pre>

<p>Next up is finding the commit id you want to go back to, to edit:</p>

<pre><code>git log
</code></pre>

<p>Make a note of the parent commit id of the commit you want to edit.</p>

          <p>I recently changed jobs and as usual was at the mercy of recruitment agents. The advert for my job contained things like ASP.Net MVC, Entity Framework &amp; TFS (luckily there were other cool pieces of technology on that list and what the role entailed interested me and once I had joined the company I saw they were open to other tech/approaches that made people’s workflow and output more beneficial to developers as well as the company. In fact I implemented an API written in <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">Nancy</a> on my first day and paved the way for Git in the first week).</p>

<p>My point being that whenever I hear from recruiters or look for jobs all the adverts basically list the full Microsoft stack. I recently heard from a friend who runs his own company that he gave his CV to a recruitment agent and was basically rejected because his .Net experience was not MS based enough. I know his .Net skills are very good but because those .Net skills were put to good use using OSS projects he is unlikely to get a job in the mainstream .Net market.</p>

<p>These adverts usually contain a list of tech/experience similar to: MVC, Webforms, Visual Studio, SQL Server, Entity Framework, WCF, LINQ.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s the common denominator here?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> They are all owned by Microsoft.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What operating system do these all run on?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Windows</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What framework and programming language do they run on?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Microsoft .Net and C#</p>

<p>Spot a pattern?</p>

<p>So lets point out the obvious, the operating system, the frameworks, the language, the tooling and the data storage are all owned and implemented by one company (and they say Apple tries to lock its users in).</p>

          <p>Lets start with the conclusion first and say “use <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> for your web applications and APIs” as its brilliant!</p>

<p>If you want to continue reading lets crack on.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on a ASP.Net MVC project and one of the controller methods writes directly to the Response, <em>eg. Response.Write(“How will I mock thee?”);</em></p>

<p>Having moved over to <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FakeItEasy/FakeItEasy">FakeItEasy</a> recently I wanted to write a unit or integration test depending how you see it to assert against the Http Response.</p>

<p>Doing this is no easy feat with MVC (with Nancy its all <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Testing-your-application">done for you</a>) and you have to mock a lot of things. I’m hoping that in later releases this will be fixed because I know that ASP.Net Web API has made things a bit easier for testing (and wrote a testing library for it) so I assume the two projects will use bits of each other or their roadmap will merge.</p>

          <p>I love my iMac and I’m on a mission to find a language I enjoy that I can use my Mac for (no Windows fan boy jokes please). There’s something in my mind I associate with work and my Windows laptop. Therefore, I don’t feel to excited about getting my laptop out of my bag in the evenings/weekends to play with other stuff.</p>

<p>As I want to broaden my knowledge I wanted to find something ideally statically typed (although I’m currently looking into Python) that would work on OS X. I’ve said previously that JavaScript seems the way to go in my current situation so I thought I’d take a look at TypeScript and also use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> from Jetbrains as my IDE seeing as I’ve heard so many great things about them and their products (don’t worry I use ReSharper).</p>

<h2>TypeScript</h2>

<p>So I went over to TypeScript’s <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">website</a> and followed the Hello World type code examples under the “Learn” tab.</p>

          <p>Whilst using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github gists</a> I’ve become a frequent user of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you that don’t know what Markdown is, its essentially a shorter/cleaner syntax that can be parsed to produce HTML. Below are a few examples:</p>

<pre><code>#Hello World!
##You're awesome!
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy coder
What the **hell** is this?
This is an [example link](http://example.com/)

&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You're awesome!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy coder&lt;/p&gt;
What the &lt;strong&gt;hell&lt;/strong&gt; is this?
This is an &lt;a href="http://example.com/"&gt; example link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can see more examples in the earlier link.</p>

<p>When you’re writing a blog post or a lengthy page in your web app with lots of HTML it maybe easier to use Markdown as your preferred syntax. I currently use WordPress for my blog, it’s ok but its quite bloated for probably what I need. I looked into <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a> and <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogr.am</a> as alternative blogging platforms but I felt it didn’t quite offer what I wanted but the approach was a good idea. It meant you could write a blog post and simply put the file in dropbox and it would appear on your blog.</p>

          <p>I’m sure there are millions of blog posts out there that already discuss this but I think its worth noting down even if its just something for me to remember.</p>

<p>Store your datetimes in UTC format into the database. Unfortunately this mean executing something like:
<code>myObject.ExpiryDate = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtc(dateTime, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(“timezoneid of users”)</code></p>

<p>In every central place where you update/insert DateTime values on your objects you will need the above.</p>

<p>When you display any DateTime information it must display as a local datetime value. You can do this by using     <code>myObject.ExpiryDate.ToLocalTime()</code></p>

          <p>As a C# developer I think I’m pretty safe in saying that its not going away any time soon however, its my opinion that to not become irrelevant you need to have options. Some may argue that its better to be master of one than a Jack of all trades but lets just say you can’t find your next job in the primary language you want to work in. What do you do?</p>

<p>I have looked more into JavaScript recently and with that comes server and client scope for the use of the language so with some understanding of JS that would be probably the best bet for me however, as much as this may annoy some I think I actually prefer statically typed languages.</p>

<p>Now I know there is <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> that I could use for my <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> apps but I see that as more of a workaround and not a core feature of JavaScript. I’m not saying anything bad against JS and the libraries/frameworks that I have used I like but I just find it easier to learn and know what I can do when I have decent intellisense showing me what I can do with my code.</p>

          <p>I recently had a need to look into using <a href="http://www.asp.net/entity-framework">Entity Framework (EF)</a> for a <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a> project. In the past I have always used <a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/">PetaPoco</a> as my ORM of choice and with hearing nothing but bad things about EF I was a little sceptical. There are various ways to use EF, Code First being one of them and the easiest from what I can gather and luckily the approach I needed to get up to speed on. This means you can define your model in code and EF will turn that into tables in your database.</p>

<p>The way I was going to see how EF could be architected in an application was to create a MVC application that provided CRUD capabilities for Customers, Orders and Products. Nothing complicated but something enough to see how EF could be fitted in with a MVC application. I would also like to use a unit of work pattern such as instantiate a model class, set some properties and call a save method. I would also like to keep the architecture well enough abstracted so that another ORM could take its place easily enough if needs be.</p>

<p>I will list the various approaches I took investigating the how EF could be integrated. They are not in any chronological order.</p>

          <p>As I stated in my earlier post <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2013/01/09/javascript-is-the-future-maybe/" title="JavaScript is the future…maybe!">“JavaScript is the future…maybe”</a> so with that in mind I had to brush up my JS skills and get more involved with the language’s core concepts so after watching some videos and reading some articles I was ready to look at <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a> and <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>

<p>Before I actually looked at these two I spent some time with <a href="http://sammyjs.org/">SammyJS</a> but realised afterwards it was mainly MVC based and not around 2-way binding that Knockout and Angular offer. However, I really liked it and it seemed very familiar and easy to use, the reason being it was inspired by <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> which we all know <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">Nancy</a> was also inspired by and we also know how much <a href="http://nancyfx.org/mvm.html">I like Nancy</a>!</p>

<p>Getting to grips with any language or frameworks is tricky and the best way to do it is to write an application using it. The next difficult thing to overcome is an idea for writing an application. ToDo list’s are very common with JavaScript frameworks and there is a whole website for you to peruse but after looking at SammyJS and their docs they walk through writing a simple shopping basket so I thought I’d use that.</p>

          <p>In <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2013/02/05/evaluating-knockoutjs-and-angularjs-part-1/" title="Evaluating KnockoutJS and AngularJS – Part 1">Part 1</a>, I described how I was using the demo tutorial from <a href="http://sammyjs.org/">SammyJS</a> to get a better understanding of <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>.</p>

<p>In this blog post I will focus on what I found when using KnockoutJS.</p>

<p>Again if you just want to get to the code then feel free to take a look here for <a href="https://github.com/jchannon/AngularShopping">Angular</a> and here for <a href="https://github.com/jchannon/KnockoutShopping">Knockout</a>.</p>

<h2>Knockout</h2>

<p>Firstly Knockout should be commended on their documentation and online tutorials. Their website tutorials follows a step by step approach and once you have completed each step you can click through to the next section. You can also leave the tutorial and come back to it and it will remember where you left. There is great support in the KnockoutJS room in Jabbr and I’d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/davepermen">David Spörri</a> for answering my newbie JS and Knockout questions.</p>
